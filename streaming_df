4,Hello! Any advice for a streamer with my specific goals?,"Hello r/streaming! Im a just starting twitch streamer, Demidemon98, and I really am not sure how to go about getting into it.

My specific goal is to be able to entertain people who like RPG's more than anything, I do most of my competitive gaming privately due to anxiety and stuff. However I also do a variety of whatever looks interesting/fun/entertaining. I like to read the lore out loud and make jokes and more than all of that, I constantly try to explain my strategy and thought process.

I hold top ten scores in a couple different games including Monster Hunter World and Doom 2016. Some of the streaming will be attempts at high scores when I come across games that allow that. 

I'm not concerned about being a top, ultra popular streamer. I'm also not doing the streaming for donations or money or anything. I would be playing the games anyway so I might as well stream them when I can, right?

I don't have much of an idea of how to build an audience or how to reach people who might be interested in my content. Any advice?

12,Hello there. I am fairly new to the world of streaming and I have a quick question regarding the time of the stream.,"Hey there. So I am a German 18 year old kid who wants to stream on twitch. All my life I always dreamt of having an English stream so that's why I'm doing it now. All my streams are exclusively in English.

Now. With the language, the audience changes too. So I was wondering when to even stream because of the time shift. The time shift between England and Germany isn't really that bad. So if I want to reach England I'll just stream at 8pm German time. But what is bad, is the time shift between Germany and America. I think when it's 8pm in New York it's 2am in Germany.

So my question would be. What do you think would be the best time to start my livestream to reach the most people?",streaming,1587458117,wastemylifewithvines,7,1,True,2020-04-21

I play drums on a live channel (just finished my first stream!) on YouTube and since the video went up after the session there is terrible stuttering in the audio. I don‚Äôt care about the video quality really although I am using a Sony A7ii tethered to the laptop for the right framing (webcam is poo). 

-

Should I turn the quality down on the camera settings? But OBS is only capturing the remote viewer window as a source (which looks pretty terrible quality), is there a way of upping the video quality with compromising the lag?

22,Xbox companion/streamlabs/mixer audio issue,"I've been streaming on Mixer through Streamlabs via Xbox Companion. My issue is, when I stream Gears 5 on console, through xbox companion on with streamlabs, the sound skips on the stream when a lot starts happening. And from what i noticed. It's only when i stream Gears 5. The sounds on the tv is fine. Sound on xbox companion is fine. But the sound on the stream starts skipping. I dont get it. Battlefront 2, Jump Force. Other random games stream across fine. Gears 5, the fighting starts and the sound on the stream starts getting choppy. 

Again setup is bare bones so tools/path:

Xbox one

Xbox companion to get on laptop (older alienware) but again, game comes across smooth on companion. The sound just chops on the stream. And just the sound.

Internet is at least 100mbps and wired into the xbox and laptop

And streamlabs to mixer. 

Any ideas how to fix it?

I am using the app [Instant Webcam](https://apps.apple.com/at/app/instant-webcam/id683949930). Simply download it and start it. In OBS you can add a webbrowser as source. As url, write the URL that the app shows you when you click on the share button. Make sure you enter a 16:9 format for width and height (such as 1280x720).

Just recently started streaming from my PS4 directly just with my mates, nothing too structured or special. would love to get into this more and will continue to stream but wanted to see if it is worth investing in going to computer streaming to increase viewers quickly? 

I currently have a MacBook Pro 2017 with decent specs, do you think I should invest in a capture card, I have looked at the Elgato HD60, I also think I would need to buy a proper mic so I can do party chat along side audio, I have stream labs and stream labs OBS but currently don't use OBS yet but have an understanding of how it works and there's probably loaddddss of other stuff I will need to and get potentially? 

Would love to hear from people who are established and maybe started out similar and see how they progressed, or people in a similar boat and see what they are thinking of doing and how they are going about it.

It's really getting me down cause no one has followed in a while and i'm only averaging .6 views a 4 hour stream, and i stream daily. My best stream has been Overwatch but even that average has dropped. My friends have stared ghosting me when I ask them why they don't show up and I cant attracted new viewers. I realize I'm new and its not easy but with even some friends help I've only attracted 2 randos. I've Done a variety of streams, (Overwatch/Hollow Knight/Terraria/Animal Crossing/Fortnite/Destiny 2/Pacify/Deceit) and have a fixed schedule of what was 12pm est and then again at 6pm but now just 6pm and each stream would run about 4 hours.

70,"Streaming industry news and highlights - week of April 13, 2020","As the world remains confined to their homes, The Roundup rolls into its 180th week - back with all the latest streaming and esports news worth knowing.  You can catch links to the full stories over on the [main page](https://blog.streamkick.com/2020/04/20/the-roundup-week-180), but quick TL;DRs are just below.

It was a week dominated by esports headlines, with many of the major players announcing changes, new leagues, and added features.  Fans of Teamfight Tactics will be happy to know there‚Äôs an official pro league just around the corner.  Activision made Call of Duty esports more accessible for amateurs looking to make a name for themselves.  Facebook Gaming is rolling out a new feature that will allow almost anyone to spin up their own tournament in a few short steps.  And both Blizzard and PUBG Corp. had major news to share on some of their core titles this week.

We hope you enjoy The Roundup, but please let us know if there‚Äôs anything we can do to make it better for you.  üëç

PUBG Corp announces replacement for canceled 2020 Global Series

TL;DR - PUBG‚Äôs Global Series was canceled this week by parent company PUBG Corp.  However, the company was quick to follow with an announcement for a new PUBG Continental Series.  The new competition will be a multi-regional, fully virtual series between Asia, Asia-Pacific, Europe, and North America.  The $2.4M prize pool will be divided evenly amongst the regions, and will kick off in May with the PCS Charity Showdown - a $400K event with an additional $400K going to charity.  Subsequent events will take place from June through August.  Full details are still pending but expected in the coming weeks.

Facebook Gaming Tournaments feature enters early access this week

TL;DR - The social network‚Äôs newest feature aims to make it easier for those stuck at home, gaming and streaming, to compete against each other in loosely organized events.  With Tournaments, Facebook Gaming users can spin up events quickly with registration, brackets, and a scoring system straight out of the box.  Formats supported include round-robin, single elimination, and double elimination.  Fundraising is optional as well to make it easy for organizers to raise money in conjunction with the matches.

Full details revealed for Hearthstone Grandmasters 2020

TL;DR - Blizzard dropped the complete details on the first season of the Hearthstone Grandmasters 2020 competition this week.  Naturally, the event will be fully virtual, with seven new contestants added to the event‚Äôs roster.  The first full season kicked off on April 17th and will run for two months, every Friday through Sunday.  Matches will be exclusively streamed on YouTube Gaming, per Blizzard‚Äôs agreement with the platform which was announced earlier this year.  The first three weeks will follow the Swiss format leading into the Group Stage.  Weeks 4 - 7 will be round robin within the two divisions of each region.  And week 8 will host the playoffs, with one player per region advancing to the World Championship at year‚Äôs end.

Riot makes VALORANT drops available to all Twitch streamers

TL;DR - Riot Games has made it possible for all Twitch streamers to enable VALORANT closed beta drops, however the number of keys actually available has not increased.  Twitch viewers can now watch any VALORANT stream on the platform and potentially score one of the coveted keys - not just the core contingent of top streamers.  All that‚Äôs required is that a viewer watches for a few hours.  The drops can even be rewarded if the viewer is offline, as long as that viewership threshold is met.

Activision unveils $250K Call of Duty League Challenger Cup series

TL;DR - The Call of Duty Challengers competition scored some love from Activision this week as it announced a new competitive series for the amateur league.  Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific will compete online for a chance at $250K in prize money.  These Challenger Cups kicked off on April 18th, and consist of five events across all three regions.  Competitors can earn Challenger Points, with the top teams taking home 5,000 points per player.  Activision has yet to explain what those points actually mean, but it‚Äôs safe to assume that‚Äôs coming soon.  Events will have their own dedicated broadcasts on Sundays throughout the life of the series, presumably on YouTube Gaming given Activision-Blizzard‚Äôs exclusive deal with the platform.

Teamfight Tactics official competitive series announced

TL;DR - Riot Games announced this week an official competitive series for its hit auto-battler, Teamfight Tactics.  With a prize pool of $200K, Teamfight Tactics: Galaxies Championship will span Brazil, China, Europe, Latin America, North America, and South Korea.  The series will feature a merit-based system for qualifying, along with regional events for highly-skilled players to score a spot.  Riot also shared community guidelines for any third-parties looking to organize their own tournaments.",streaming,1587512981,NastyCamper,0,0,True,2020-04-21

First a little context.
I'm the host of a podcast for political discussion in Chile.
Because of the pandemic we were recording in remote mode using zoom just because one of us already have an account and is easy to use for the guests.

Not great sound but works.

Now we want to record the show and at the same time do a live streaming on facebook.

What software do you recommend to customize the streaming?

Zoom can stream directly to facebook but is really dull. I want something were I can show some fullscren image while people wait and be able to reproduce some background music.

I now about obs, streamlabs obs and ecamm live.

I test ecamm live today and the output sound from zoom didn't work on the streaming ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Also is kind of hard to select the screen, what I did was have zoom maximized but not full screen and ok top of that ecamm live screen...can the app stream from fullscreen mode?

Will be better go with obs? What about live comments and scenes with background m√∫sic (like opening and interlude).

Any recommended app or workflow?

101,Headset issues/Streamlabs issues," So recently I got a nice gaming PC and have been looking forward to playing games and streaming with it. However, I have been running into a few issues with my headset and audio in Streamlab OBS.

For reference, I have a Razer Kraken X with the Razer Surround Sound Drivers (I also have the Realtek Audio Drivers). I have had issues with my headset for several months now. About 4-5 months ago before I had my PC and was using my laptop, my laptop refused to recognize my microphone on the headset and only used the built in mic on the laptop. The cables like to twist up over time, so I'm wondering if that has anything to do with it.

Recently, my friends have complained that my mic has been ""oscillating"" whenever I speak in Discord or Cisco WebEx. By oscillating, I mean when I speak, it will start out loud, then get quiet after me speaking for a few seconds, get loud a few seconds later, get quiet a few seconds after that, and so on.

I downloaded Streamlabs and tested out my stream but you can only hear my voice, not any of the in game sounds. I've tried messing with audio settings in Streamlabs but now it seems totally screwed up.

Basically my questions are is my headset the problem and need to get a new one or is this fixable? If fixable, what should I do? As for streamlabs, does anyone have any idea how to fix this? I really would like to start streaming.",streaming,1587538427,RetiredSwimmer99,0,1,True,2020-04-21
102,A few questions about streaming from Streamlabs,"Hi everyone,

I am new to streaming to Twitch through Streamlabs and I have a few questions which I hope you will help me find an answer to.

&amp;#x200B;

1) I am using a 4G connection to stream with an upload speed of \~21MB/s. Let's say I have a plan of 1GB/day. Will that be sufficient? Will I be downloading too much data while streaming or it's just uploaded data?

2) I have set the video bitrate to 2500 in Streamlabs and 224 for the audio bitrate. Is that suitable?

3) I have done a test stream and I noticed that in the settings of my live stream (in Twitch site) people can only use one resolution for the video (720px). My PC/canvas resolution is 1920x1080px. I have also tried setting the output (scaled) resolution to 1080px but Streamlabs resets it back to 720px as soon as the stream starts. Is there a way to address this issue so that people are able to change resolutions in the stream video panel with 1080px (native) added too? 

PS. I am using NVENC (new) as the encoder for both video and audio and I have set the Encoder Preset to Max Quality.

129,Need GPU Recommendation,"Hey all! I am a low tier streamer and I play various FPS games such as Escape From Tarkov and Hunt: Showdown and I am sure I will branch out to other titles and genres at some point.

&amp;#x200B;

I have only been streaming again for a few months but as I compare my stream quality to that of others I find myself lacking. After doing some independent study/testing with various software settings I realized that streamlabs obs was on average around 20 fps and sometimes dropping to 7 (This only happens on Hunt:Showdown. Tarkov usually runs at 28-30 FPS) Now my viewers enjoy my content and dont mind the poor quality. However, I want to do right by them and myself as a content creator. I am looking to spend between 300-350 USD on a gpu unless the next tier is a decent performance boost for the cost increase.

I am currently trying to decide between MSI's GeForce GTX 1660 TI Gaming X 6GB for 319.99 and 

EVGA's KO Ultra Gaming NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 6GB for 309.99

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone could provide some insight or recommendations I would greatly appreciate it!

i7 9700k 

32 GB DDR4 

GTX 1050 TI 4GB

We are 3 players who have existing youtube and twitch communities that are looking to get a group of 10-12 players in total. The idea is to have a very similar vibe to Hermitcraft to start with and grow organically, together.

The requirements are simple, have to be a dedicated vanilla player willing to put the time and effort to create regularly scheduled content. Streams, youtube, collabbing with each other, maintain shops and have a fun time with this project.

The server is high end, we will use the vanilla tweaks that Hermitcraft has already, we have a seed in mind that was posted on the main minecraft subreddit recently and the plan is to start in 1.15.2 and wipe Nether once 1.16 rolls around. We want to start now so we can be in to the groove of things by 1.16.

Previously I was using the 2nd gen Astro A50s where I had the USB power into the mixamp plugged into my computer and the optical cable plugged into my PS4. This allowed me to hear audio from both my streaming pc (for alerts and what not) as well as my PS4 simultaneously. For my chat mic on PS4, I plugged in a USB lapel microphone and just clipped it onto my boom arm for my USB microphone that I used to talk to my stream. Now that Ive implemented the GOXLR, I want to get its full functionality with being able to control my PS4 volume, XLR Mic volume, PC volume, and hopefully also able to mute my lapel microphone for when im talking to stream to not distract my teammates. Is this possible? Currently I have the optical cable running from my PS4 to the GOXLR and then a 3.5mm cable running from the headset port of the GOXLR to the Astro A50 mixamp. I have the USB from the GOXLR connected directly into the streaming PC and currently Im able to get audio from both however Im not able to control the PS4 audio. (But Im sure thats just because I havent assigned the optical volume in the GOXLR software yet). My main question I am coming here today with is being able to control that USB lapel microphone that I have plugged into the PS4. It does have a 3.5mm headphone jack on it, I just need to know if I can wire that in a way to mute the microphone or not. Thank you for any help!

244,Want to host a live art conference with multiple presenters,"I work for an art gallery that was going to have a conference in May where about 200 people come to the gallery and see 10 different presenters do a demonstration/speech in their own 30 minute time slot. Obviously we can no longer host this gathering in person so we are trying to do an online version. 

I want to know which streaming platform is best to use to host this conference. Ideally it had the following features:

\-I maintain control of all the presenters (I can mute them, or cut their presentation at any time)

\-The presenters can present live in real time

\-some of the artists presenting will be streaming from other countries like England and Italy

\-I can stream the conference on facebook live and instagram live, as well as on a website that doesn't require anyone make an account or download anything (like Zoom). This is important because many of the attendees are older and are not tech literate. It would be best if I could just be able to put a button on my website that says ""CLICK HERE TO SEE THE CONFERENCE""

\-It isn't important that we can see the attendees, but ideally there could be a Q&amp;A feature where they can type in questions that the artists can read and answer aloud in their stream

\-I need to be able to record the conference and post it on youtube afterwards.

&amp;#x200B;

250,Ticketed Video Streams to Support Japan's Underground Music Scene Amidst COVID-19,"Heyo, yr friendly neighborhood metalman here, again, Tokyometal, and I come bearing good news during these brvtal coronatimes!

As everywhere else, music scenes are struggling immensely here in Japan, and this includes the independent extreme music scene. We've been hard at work looking for viable solutions to raise funds, awareness, and appreciation of the bands, venues, and people that make the scene here so great, and we think we've got a promising one: ticketed live streaming with help from our friends over at [Zaiko](https://www.zaiko.io).

This is a test run, so it's not perfect; we like to think of it as a proof of concept. So, for ¬•500 (~$5), you can get a 7 minute earful of one of the best sludge bands operating today, [Floaters](https://floatersjapan.bandcamp.com/), playing the track Unconscious off of their newly released album Roman Holiday, and it was filmed with no audience at one of the most important venues in Japan for the extreme music community, [El Puente](https://www.facebook.com/El-Puente-214096195273923/).

We're still working on the math as this is our first go around, but if we ran the numbers right we should be able to donate between 80% and 90% of proceeds after costs to El Puente (originally, it was to both Floaters and El Puente, but Floaters kindly donated their cut to El Puente).

Our hope with this admittedly short stream is to show that its possible to produce content on the cheap, set up a stream, and get people from all over to tune in and contribute what they can, and then to reproduce it sustainably. Of course, at such a low price its a matter of scale, so if you're interested, able, and willing, any word of mouth you could muster would be much appreciated!

Anyway, if that sounds neat, check out the stream this Saturday at from 7:15PM (Japan Standard Time) [here](https://kaala.zaiko.io/_item/325738). And if you'd like to read a little bit more about it Hong Kong's Unite Asia covered it in a feature today which you can find [here](https://uniteasia.org/japans-kaala-tries-new-approach-streaming-within-dire-times-japanese-venues/)

I'm also supposed to speak on a microphone a couple times during the set. All of this has to be submitted by April 27th, so the director can ""stream"" these sets to the festival attendees. 

Here's my equipment:

\-2015 MacBook Pro

\- Iphone XR

\-Blue Yeti Microphone USB 

\- Traktor S4 Controller 

\-Presonus Audio Interface 

\-Various lighting equipment. 

Here's my software:

\-Traktor Pro 2

\-Ableton Live 10

\-OBS

\-iMovie 

Here's my issue - Originally I was going to live stream the set. I was going to run OBS with Audio capture from the ""MJ recording device"" from Mac, and use the video from the 720p Camera on the MacBook Pro. this was the most ideal setup. However, When routing the audio from Traktor through the MJ recording device, it allowed the stream to hear the music being played in Traktor with minimal loss in audio quality, but impossible for me to hear it. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I'd like to do is Record me playing my set at 1080p or 4k video from the iPhone XR. And record the audio in Traktor separately. Then sync the audio to the video after the fact. The issue with this is running a microphone... I have no way to run a microphone through Traktor to record my voice. 

Basically, I need to find a solution ASAP. I'm not sure exactly what to do. Is there a software I can download that I haven't heard of? Is there any other equipment I need to buy? 

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully, I don't come off as completely dumb, and if I need to post this in another sub I'd be happy to do so.

I tried doing that using Voicemeeter potato and even though it could somehow channel incoming audio into virtual inputs, I can't figure out how to put a filter on these and considering it messes up the volume quite a lot, either I'm not using it properly or it's not the best software for my use case.

434,Recommendation for mic and at home personal Zoom (streaming?) setup,"This may be slightly off topic for this group, but I think many of you all will likely would be able to point me in the right direction.

I have been thinking about an ideal at home video conference setup that caputures my voice in high quality.

I currently have a lav, but I am often moving around (e.g. handling kids, bio breaks, etc) and it‚Äôs annoying to clip it on and off. I don‚Äôt want the mic visible in frame like I see in most streaming setups, and I don‚Äôt want to deal with charging mics transmitters. I‚Äôve done some research (but definitely a noob) which I believe leaves me with boom mics (shotgun or super cardiod mics).

An additional wrinkle is that I want to hear audio from the other participants on a loud speaker. I don‚Äôt want to have to use headphones. I currently use a Jabra 510 which is great but it does not capture high quality audio. I am worried about feedback the mic would capture from conference audio output.

Does anyone have a recommendation for a mic or setup that could work for me? Also how to ‚Äúcancel‚Äù any feedback I get from a conference speaker?

Some more details I‚Äôll spend up to $1000 (or even more) if it works. I use a Macbook Pro.

442,Streaming Troubles - Need Help ASAP,"This might be long, will add summary at bottom.

First of all thank you for reading. I have scoured the internet and made changes to my setup but nothing seems to help overall. 

Just started streaming in January PS4 &gt; 4k60 PRO &gt; Stream Elements OBS. No real issues when running like this. 

Last week I tried to stream and play on my pc (Escape from Tarkov and Warzone) Both were super laggy and I noticed that my RAM was maxed out so I upgraded and upgraded to a new m.2 drive because why not. 

Specs:  
 CPU: Ryzen 5 2600x  
CPU Cooler: H100iV2  
MOBO: B450 AORUS Pro Wifi  
RAM: G.Skill Trident Z 32gb 3200mhz (2x 3200mhz &amp; 2x 3600 NEO)  
GPU: GTX 1080 FE  
PSU: EVGA SuperNova G2 750w   
Dell s2716DG 1440p / 144hz

Runs the game great... fresh install of Windows 10 PRO - full updates  
But it looked like dawg ish... Looked like lag on OBS

OBS Settings old:   
720p 60fps - 4500 bit rate  
NVENC - Hardware encoding

You could see a constant frame drop not from network but from ""Skipped frames due to encoding lag"" which I was reading is due to the CPU but it wasn't maxed out either.. The other one ""Frames missed due to rendering lag"" would pop up also a bit, So I switched to the following.

OBS Settings NEW:  
720p 60fps - 5000 bit rate  
x264 - Software encoding

And it did get a little bit better but I still had to drop the games down to 1080p rather than 1440p and then it seemed to get better with random lags in the game (maybe like 1 second lag in game) Random on stream but the numbers still pop up a bit on the ""stats"" in OBS  


MY ASK: 

What do I need to optimize/change anything will help even if its a dumb question or obvious please ask/tell/yell/beat me I don't care. I want to stream and play but it just isn't going well unless I do console &gt; PC  


Not to drop my stream but [twitch.tv/YaboiCamSTL](https://twitch.tv/YaboiCamSTL) the last video from today shows the issues at the start and got better the last two hours or so. I can't paste images so that is the best I can do!   


TL;DR:

\-Trying to stream and game on the same pc (specs above)

\-Stream looked like crap and lagged a lot so I changed the settings (settings above)

\-Looks better but still not optimized. Please provide tips/tricks

502,YouTube Gaming vs Twitch,"I decided that I want to start streaming and the first thing I need to do is to choose which platform I'll be hosting it on.  The main ones that I took into consideration are YouTube Gaming and Twitch.  The content I need to host is all highlights from my last streams, my full stream recording, and YouTube videos I'll create specifically for that platform.  What I thought is, as I'm going to have a YouTube channel either way, and I don't have already an audience to move from Twitch to YT, it's worth starting with YouTube because the people who are going to see my stream are going to subscribe and watch the video made specifically for YouTube too.  While, if I started with Twitch, I'll probably have a higher starting audience because Twitch is widely more used, but the YouTube channel is going to stick very well because I'd need to transfer people from one platform to one another every time.  At this point, the crucial question is: is the higher starting audience I *could* get with Twitch worth starting with it instead of building all my audience on a single platform and, thus, getting it more bonded with my contents?",streaming,1587900113,leonardosharp,0,1,True,2020-04-26

510,Just couple of curious question about streaming,"Hello guys,

I am not a streamer and I have never streamed in my entire life anything. And I very likely won't. 

But I like watching couple of people from time to time streaming, especially about retro games and such.

There couple of things that I am really curious about even tho I don't plan to be streamer. I know it's lazy and maybe some of the questions could be easily googleable, but I hope you can aswer them for me.

1) How come the computer is not heard in the stream? It's very loud thing, with all that coolers. It does loud fan sound all the time. Do all streamers have some special water cooled computer or...? When I plug in my microphone, I can hear not only the computer and keyboard typing, but also birds singing outside :D

2) How do you deal with potential issue that can simply stop your streaming? Computer restarts for some reason. Blue screen of death of some random error. You lost your internet connection. Electricity issues. Your annoying family members?

3) How a person becomes a streamer anyway? You're like... buy expensive mic and camera and try it, and then you realize it's not fun as you expected to be and you don't like it, so you wasted your money?

4) How you do set volumes anyway? How do you set the same volume as the game you're playing?

Ok, maybe stupid questions, but I am really curious about it :)

554,[HELP] Issue with animated Webcam Overlay,"I've recently started using an animated overlay for my webcam in SLOBS. 

It's been rendered to run at 60 fps and does so when I first switch the scene but after a handful of seconds it drops to a very low (for sake of example, let's say 5 fps) and stays that way unless I make a small change in its properties, but again, after a handful of seconds it drops fps.

585,Kinda Confused about Capture Cards,"Ok so I'm getting things ready and doing research to start buying everything I need to stream live content using my game consoles. 

So far one of the things really confusing me are the capture cards. Now I know the gist of it: the capture card is connected to both the console and computer you're using, and that's how it captures what's on screen. 

What I'm confused about is the audio portion of it all. I watched a video and basically the person was saying that it would be advisable to get a digital optical headset that operates off a mix amp. Because apparently if you use a USB headset that's plugged into the console, only the visuals will go through the card and into the stream. 

So I guess that's where I get confused. Do I really need that type of headset? I dont mind getting one, I just dont understand it 100% honestly. Especially because I use a headset that plugs into my console controllers, not into the console themselves. So will that issue with the audio still occur if that's the case? I kinda just assumed that if you had the capture card, you could just speak through your headset mic and it would be ok. 

As I'm sure you can tell, I'm not the most tech savvy person, especially since I'm new to streaming set ups. So can someone help me out and maybe dumb this down for me? Lol I just wanna make sure I'm getting what I need to now. If its something that can wait a little longer down the line, cool. But if it's better to just get it now, I wanna know what I should be looking for and why.

So I‚Äôm looking into this as a bit of a side project for my partner (something about wanting to be on the death star for a work meeting) and started looking into how to setup a green screen and chromakey things.

I‚Äôve used OBS a bit and and reasonably comfortable with it (in the sense that I can setup and stream happily) and found that it can do the chromakey through the virtual cam module that has been developed. This is good but I have an issue in that my partner is attending this meeting on her work laptop and therefore can‚Äôt install any software. Not a huge problem I thought as i had already figured out you could ‚Äúinstall‚Äù OBS as a portable installation on a thumb drive and just run it from there. Only issue is that the virtual cam isn‚Äôt a registered service and therefore cannot select it as an output source. 

Anyone have any ideas of portable software implementations of chromakey and how to run these?

607,Microphone feedback problems,"Hi, 

I was wondering if anyone could offer any advice or knows anything more on feedback issues using two microphones on playstation live. 

My daughter has been keen to set up a gaming channel so me and her can play games together online.
We record live using the ps4 camera and we dont tend to edit any of our clips as we just stream live to youtube. 
We both have gaming headsets and we play both audio and microphone input via these. 
I have a set of turle beach and my daughter has tried a few different gaming headphones to try resolve the issue.

The problem is, my daughter picks up really bad feedback which makes what she is saying completely inaudible. 
I cant use the ps4 camera mic as this will shut off my turtle beaches completely and her headset also. 
If I did that and turned the headsets off I would need to run the sound from my tv which would create more feedback in the cameras microphone. 

My headset doesn't appear to be getting any feedback but hers do. 
There is a link underneath to a stream we did yesterday and in the clip she is using some samsung phone headphones. 
She has a gaming headset with microphone but they also have the same issue.

 I really want to get it working right for us both so any help or advice would be truly appreciated! Thank you! [sound issue](https://youtu.be/byU9Wwm9LDc)",streaming,1587985000,Kyledidntdoit,3,1,True,2020-04-27

643,Laptop streaming connection issues,"Hi, I've been using PS4 remote play to stream on my laptop for about a month now. My laptop does not have a dedicated ethernet port, so I purchased an ethernet to USB C adapter. It's been working well but I have a capture card coming and need that USB C port for it. So I purchased a different adapter that has two regular USB ports, an ethernet port, and a USB C port on it. My laptop has three regular USB ports and one USB C port on it, all are 3.0. I just did a speed test because the last couple of streams have had some issues. With the Ethernet to USB C adapter I have speeds of 230 down and 11 up, the same over wifi. With the new adapter I have speeds of 89 down and 10 up.

Is this going to happen with every adapter with multiple ports on it or did I just get a bad one? Should I be able to expect getting better download speeds if I got an ethernet to regular USB adapter? With download and upload speeds like I have over wifi would I experience issues over wifi while streaming with the router right next to the laptop.

Sometimes I'm streaming alone and others I might be with my fiance and friends. 
I love playing simulation games, choice story games, and party games (like jackbox) with the occasional rpg thrown in. Always looking to expand the options. 
I love to stream and just chat with the people hanging out in the chat with us! 
It's my goal to build an awesome community and make everyone feel welcome, I'm just getting started and the sky's the limit. 

Occasionally I'll join in chat and stream with twitch.tv/umbreonuntamed so check us out!

So I started streaming recently, and I have a problem.  
To give the context, I've got 2 monitors. One 60 hz and the other 144hz. Obviously I play on the 144 one and have chat and all the other infos on the 60 one.  
The problem is, evrytime I have a ""movement"" on the 60 hz screen, the 144 hz one has fps lags.  
For exemple when there is a video (except in fullscreen, then it doesn't bug) or in my case, when theres the chat.  


Everytime someone writes something, it gives me fps losses. How could I prevent that ? (Other than just looking at my phone..)

I recently started streaming my D&amp;D to Twitch. There 6 of us all from different regions. Ones based in Canada the rest are across the US. We've been using Zoom for voice and cam. My issue is, once and a while my signal from Zoom will start to get choppy. I'll only hear every other word and the cam feed will freeze. My signal still shows healthy even when i experience this. I have heard port forwarding may help but I wanted to check here for possible solutions as well. I'd greatly appreciate any help.  


P.S. I have also thought about increasing my internet package speed from 200 to 1000 but when i google that option i get conflicting info. Some say it'll help, some say it would accomplish nothing.   


P.S.S. I am open to other FREE video conferencing software suggestions if anyones had any luck.

I'm a film school grad, so I'm very familiar with camera and editing stuff, but just wrapping my head around streaming. 

Once upon a time I was going to do a couples stream with my gf, so I bought 2 stream set ups (2xhd60's , 2x tonor mics with accessories, 2 xboxes, 2 TV's etc).
Unfortunately we broke up before I set everything up.

So since I have all this free time with covid-19, I'm setting up my stream. I have a spare gh4 I could dedicate to it.

The capture card (El gato hd60) can do either my tv (console) or my camera, but not both (apparently you can't use two El Gatos hd60's in OBS).


Is there someway I can use/Jerry rig 2x hd60 to stream from my console and my DSLR?

Can I stream from camera to a window on my PC, and capture that window in an OBS in a layer above the gameplay layer? 

If not... What CAN I do with two hd60's?? other than offer a giveaway on a stream someday üòÖ",streaming,1586842217,DescartesTruth,0,2,True,2020-04-13

4 GB of DDR3 ram  


250 GB SSD

 I'm interested in playing some games online with some people while sharing audio from various places, but only recording the voices.

 So here's the full story - I want to play some DnD with some friends and also share some music from spotify and ambient sound from a browser based application with them to add to our enjoyment of the game. However, I want to record only our voices so that I can cut it up later without the music jumping around, and re-layer that music later.

Now let's get down to brass tax. I've been flirting with streaming for a while and even did a few small streams (with like no viewers obliviously) but after debating with the bois during a gaming night I decided to ""officially"" try my first stream. 

So, after setting up all the technical side of the stream, I am coming to you with 2 reasons: 

1. I am hoping this post will get me some attention and hopefully bring even just a few persons. 
2. I wanted my first stream to be for a good cause and with all the corona virus stuff happening in the world I decided it should be a charity stream. Now in order to stimulate people to donate I was thinking of doing challenges at different milestones (for example the biggest one is probably gonna be to dye my hair a colour that the chat will choose).

And so, we finally get to the point: What do you think would be good stuff to do for these challenges? I am looking for stuff that I could mostly do on the spot and on stream of course.

91,Capture card stuttering/lagging,"Hi all,


I've been streaming for like 5/6 months. I absolutely loving it but there's now a huge problem out of nowhere. When my cam is enabled on slobs, the capture card start lagging/stuttering. Whenever I turn the camera off, the capture card is smooth as butter or if I keep the cam on and put the capture card option in slobs video format to ""MJPEG"" but takes a lot cpu usage which puts it on 15/20% and I get fps drops which even freezes the stream sometimes for 2 seconds. I'd rather have it without MJPEG format on so it can be on 4/9% cpu usage. 

I was thinkin bout ""maybe my USB hubs are overloaded"" but will it be solved if I get an additional USB hub and plug everything on that one? Or do I need one with external power? This bothers me a lot and don't know what to do.

I stream on a separate laptop. It has i5 9th Gen, 8 gb ram but will be soon 16 and gtx 1650 super. I never had issues and now it's being rude towards me.

Settings on slobs are 
Simple
720p 59 fps
5500 bitrate (got 1 gig up and down) 
Nvenc (new) 
Lanzcos

I already contacted slobs about this and they told me about that USB hub extention and or to stream on with MPJEG or upgrading tto pc which will happen hopefully at the end of this year.

**Gaming PC (it is beefy):**

* i9-9900K
* Nvidia 1080 TI
* 64 GB RAM
* 1 TB SSD for C Drive
* 3 TB HDD for E Drive
* 240 HZ Monitor for Display

I currently run a 3-monitor set-up - 2 for Gaming PC - 1 for Stream PC.  I run one Display Port to my Gaming Monitor - 1 HDMI to second Gaming Monitor -  1 HDMI to the capture card in the Stream PC.

I use OBS and use EL GATO's software to manage capture card settings - as is required for the hardware.  

My 2020 Goals Include: 

* Improving my general overlay
* Investing in a more premium microphone
* **Figuring out this quality issue**

# Description of Issue and Actions Taken

The captured video from my gaming pc seems to produce a tearing effect. This effect is extremely visible when I turn *or* when I pass objects.  I play mostly fast paced FPS games that require a higher bitrate (current bitrate for Twitch is 4800)  You can view a sample of the captured video from any of my recent past broadcasts: 

[twitch.tv/bcxtv](https://twitch.tv/bcxtv)

Actions Taken

* Spoke in great lengths with El Gato Support
* Tweaked post-processing in both El Gato Software and OBS
* Lowered resolution of captured video to 720p
* Applied troubleshooting steps from a variety of OBS and El Gato community and support forums

**I don't know what to try next. As I understand it - my current  stream RIG should crank out 720p @ 60 frames easily. What I can not figure out is WHY does it look so bad?**

P.S.

I have considered using a single PC setup. My current rig is more than enough to stream from - but I am being stubborn and *really* want to make this dual-pc set up work. Am I being stubborn for no reason?

I get high quality recordings with a track that has just the game, the game plus my comms, and the game plus comms plus music. I had been using the MKVToolNix programs to just repackage whichever video/audio combination I wanted to send someone.

I'm just now starting to pay closer attention to my stream quality, archives for mixing into a youtube video, etc., so I forked over the $20/month to get Premiere Pro, Media Encoder, and all those nice adobe things. Unfortunately, adobe doesn't support MKV in any of their products anymore. When they did, it was unofficially anyway. That means, I have to repackage all my OBS recordings before I can even start editing them.

196,High Ping while Streaming,"Hi folks! New to streaming, but quickly getting the hang of it. Been streaming Skyrim and DOOM Eternal the past few days, with no real issues.   


However, tonight, my old tribe got me back into Ark, as some of the admins of our old server broke off and started their own, they roped me back in. 

Normally when I play ARK, I have a ping of between 14-28. When I started streaming however, that jumped up to about 118.   


I'm not sure why this is occurring, as I have a pretty good setup and I think my SLOBS is set correctly.

My upload results from testmy.net sits at **21.9 Mbps**

Download results were  Minimum :: **634.43 Mbps** | Middle :: **894.31 Mbps** | Maximum :: **1006.63 Mbps**

Any insight onto why this is happening would be greatly appreciated, and any further info you might need point it out to me and I'll be happy to amend the post. 

Despite the ping on the game itself, there's no real noticeable lag between input and output, even while using Mobcrush to upload to multiple sites at once. There's maybe 4 seconds between an action and streaming on Twitch, Mixer, Facebook and Youtube, which seems pretty normal to me, and it all comes through in superb high quality.",streaming,1587026113,StarfellWriter,4,1,True,2020-04-16

Backstory:

Since my band's album release tour was canceled, we're trying to do a fun livestream in place of the tour kickoff show. 

We're trying to do a run-through of Pokemon Red through an emulator using nothing but Metapod for battles while our album plays on repeat. 

&amp;#x200B;

So we're trying to figure out the best way to simultaneously stream: 

1. The pokemon game with no sound
2. A webcam shot of the person playing the pokemon game with their voice being recorded
3. webcam audio and video of 2 different band members in 2 different locations (not playing pokemon game, but answering questions people send us via social media)
4. The album playing on repeat (preferably a way to have this be muted or have customized volume levels for the band members. I think I'll go crazy listening to our album on repeat for 12 hours. Perhaps an option to adjust the volume for the audience as well if possible)
5. A way to have all of this be simultaneously streamed live across facebook, twitch, youtube, and instagram. 

&amp;#x200B;

So in summary: 

Video: 1 game, 3 webcams

Audio: Microphone from 3 separate computers, 1 streaming album

Streamed across: facebook, twitch, youtube, and instagram.

246,Hiring Live Streamers,"We are currently hiring singers, models and dancers to be paid hosts on our live streaming phone app. The position pays between $400-$24,000 a month for 30 hours of live broadcasting. The amount you make depends on the gifts that you receive, which you also keep. Base pay is paid monthly, but you can cash out your gifts on a weekly basis. Our most popular broadcasters have the ability to entertain, connect and engage with viewers all at once, so an outgoing personality is a must!

In order to obtain a paid position on the app, you need to set up an audition. With the number of people quarantined or unable to go into work right now, demand is really up on the app! If you are able to secure an audition, please ensure you are 100% committed to the timeslot and are able to commit to logging on 10 minutes before your audition begins. If you are unable to make your scheduled time, or log in late, you will be unable to reschedule.

The audition will be just like a regular broadcast, you will log in, showcase your talent and interact and engage with viewers. The audition will take 30 mins and you will be notified within 24 hours if you have been accepted as a paid host. We are currently hiring for hosts beginning April 1 but will consider some earlier hires if hosts have previous experience and following.

If you are interested in setting up an audition, please email apply@couchfame.com with links to your current social media (Instagram preferred), links to current live broadcasting profiles (please do not respond to this ad if currently under an exclusive contract with another app) and 2-3 dates and times that would work best to audition (afternoon works best).",streaming,1587071650,canadiansammy,0,0,True,2020-04-16

They do have a GoPro that I suggested we might be able to use or we will have to look into getting a webcam. 

We appreciate any advice on how to set up the GoPro if that‚Äôs possible or what affordable webcams you would recommend. 

The problem with the iPad was all the movements would blur and make it hard to see kicks &amp; punches. The camcorder is old and looks like a poor quality old home recorded video but at least it doesn‚Äôt blur movements as much as the iPad.

259,Optimal Settings for 1080p 60fps Streaming to Twitch.,"Ok so I recently upgraded my PC and have been streaming to twitch. What I'm hoping to achieve with this post is knowing which settings I should use (With StreamlabsOBS). So first things first, I'm trying to stream mostly not too demanding games like Overwatch and Dead by Daylight. Now onto my pc specs :

CPU - i9-9900k, GPU - RTX 2080 TI, RAM - 16GB 3600Mhz

So as you can see, my computer is pretty beefy. My goal here is to stream with no reduction in quality, with as small of a performance hitch as possible.

So what am I asking for more specifically? Things like the encoder. Should I use the x264 cpu based one? NVENC, the newer one at that? What's the best bitrate (for Twitch, again)? What should I set my CPU Usage Preset to? Bicubic, Bilinear, or Lanczos?

Sorry if these are dumb questions, thanks in advance for any answers, however!

I attempted a stream for the first time using an old game (Fallout: NV) and OBS over YouTube.  Prior to this, I'd recorded a few gameplay videos and simply uploaded them without a hitch. Well, other than YouTube's garbage codec taking my hi-res video and raking them over the coals....

Imagine my surprise when I tried to stream a fifteen year old game and my frame rate for the entire desktop dropped to like...10. Turns out you're encoding while streaming? Which... I thought you were doing that during a regular recording session too. An expert on YouTube suggests you simply turn the resolution of the game you're streaming down, freeing up more memory for the encoder. This made little impact.

I find it very hard to believe I can't stream Fallout NV at 480p with my current hardware without such bad performance.

I tinkered with various settings, changing the container, lowering quality, etc but nothing seemed to have any effect on performance. I've decided I'm in over my head and have come to you guys.

Gaming PC with dual monitors. I also have my Nintendo Switch and Xbox 1 x hooked up to these monitors and I stream with an elgato hd60s. I use my headset Arctis 3's using the 3.5mm jack. Through that headset I have it set up to hear PC audio while I game on either the Switch or X1X with my voice coming through my AT2020 USB mic. 

My issue is when I stream x1x and need to chat with party or in game chat. I can't use my USB mic I have to unplug my arctis 3's directly into my xbox controller to chat. But then the stream loses in game chat or party chat. I'm wondering if to get this all to work fluidly do i need a mixer such as the goxlr or am I missing a setting to get this to work the way I want. 

Sorry if this is confusing. To sum this up I want to be able for my stream to hear my voice and in game chat or party chat with this set up. And don't know if its a setting or do I need a mixer. Any help will be greatly appreciated.",streaming,1587181506,kidwgm,3,2,True,2020-04-17

372,Best Way to Adjust Mic EQ/levels etc live? (for example for Mic input for Skype/Discord/Gaming),"I  have an Audio Technica AT2020 USB mic. Nowadays I mostly just use it  for voice chat in video games or Discord. However to me it sounds bass heavy among other things and would just like to be able to tweak the sound (beyond using a pop filter and changing distance to the mic.)

What  is the best way to do this for live audio like voice chat and streaming (especially voice chat, where latency is an issue?) 

In the past I used a program called Virtual Audio Cable and I do have an older version of Adobe Audition, and I used them together to do what I'm  asking. HOWEVER - that  introduced  considerable lag, so people I was talking to heard me about half a second later than I was speaking. This caused a lot of annoying talking over each other. (I was not very familiar with the  programs, so it's possible I may have set something up wrong.)

So I'm hoping for recommendations on the best and/or easiest way to tweak **live** audio from my USB mic? Hopefully through software as I think it'd be overkill to get extra hardware just for voice chat.

378,"How to fix ""Blurry"" Stream","Hi I've been streaming for a little while on Twitch. One thing that I have noticed so far is that my streams (especially webcam for some reason) distort and look very blurry as I play my games. 

My primary game is Rocket League, and I know that it can be a difficult game to stream as there is a lot of fast movement for the output to catch up on but even with my encoding settings cranked it still does not look good.

I currently am streaming at 720p 60fps using Streamlabs OBS and have my Bitrate set to 6,000. While I watch the counter while I am streaming and it says that it is outputting around 5,000-6,500 kb/s while my stream is running. My current upload speed is around 16mbps aswell.

I have looked online for days trying to figure something out and have found nothing. I have looked at several ""optimal settings"" videos and still with their help it is not helping my situation.

My computer is capable of running the game and stream at the same time as I have checked their usage during streams and they are only at about 60-70% for GPU and 20-30% for CPU.

I have also tried using NVENC and x264 and found better results with NVENC. 

Here are my current specs and settings.

CPU: Ryzen 7 3700X
GPU: GTX 1070
RAM: 32gb DDR4

433,Getting started in streaming,"Hello everyone

A bit about myself. I am 21 years of age, Male, born and raised in the UK, I also have an absolute passion for competitive gaming. I have been wanting to make a living of playing video games ever since I was a kid. The only thing that has been stopping me is the motivation to keep uploading videos to YouTube and just overall being consistent. I have put effort in making and uploading content to YouTube inconsistently since I can remember, the reasoning for me being so inconsistent has been because of my views and the feeling of not getting anywhere. I have downloaded Streamlabs OBS and have spent hours trying to figure out the best quality and streaming settings (yes I have looked up tutorials but nothing seemed to have the same results). I have a mindset of which game I would like to stream and that is Overwatch. I have moved over from console to PC and am currently in Diamond as a tank main. I have hit Grandmaster on the 3 different accounts back on console, however am now struggling to get out of Diamond on PC. I keep doing my research, looking up tutorials and getting advice from watching my favourite tank streamers. My question and whole point of this post is to ask if anyone knows any streaming 1 to 1 coaches that I can speak to,  I will pay money and give it 100% as I think it's time to share my game knowledge and skills, mainly to connect with the YouTube or Twitch community. I have been thinking what streaming platform is best for me, personally I would like to stream on YouTube as I think it might be a little easier for me to get started. I currently have a YouTube channel that sits at 1k subs, however that isn't much use if I am getting 0 views per upload. I have put countless hours into video games, this is now my time for me to really make those hours count. I am 100% committed and ready to move forward.

437,Making My Canon PowerShot sx530 HS a webcam for Twitch Streaming,"Hello all!

I have a Canon PowerShot sx530 HS camera. I am currently trying to live stream with it on my Dell computer and have spent weeks researching and trying to buy the right hardware to no avail. Here's what I've attempted so far...

First off the camera is said to be able to do remote streaming and has the capability to connect to your computer or android through WiFi. I tried that but the only software provided only allows downloading existing images and videos to what ever device is connected. Maybe there is a software I'm missing? Also, my computer recognizes it it through WiFi but always says ""Not Connected"" I have tried going to the EOS Utility download page which is said to be software for remote shooting on DSLR cameras but my model wasn't listed as all of them were EOS. This makes me wonder if my camera has an EOS code and if it does I don't know where to find it. (I am super green to learning about tech)

Second, I attempted with cables based on videos titled ""Turn Any DSLR Camera into a Webcam"". This sent me down a cable rabbit hole I'm still sitting in. The first video recommended a ""CamLink"" and since those are sold out pretty much everywhere, I tried to find something similar so I got an Insignia Video Adapter with an HDMI port and a USB-A end to connect into the computer. I got an HDMI to Mini HDMI cable to connect the adapter to the camera and while it recognizes the video adapter it doesn't recognize the camera (and yes it's turned on XD). Also, StreamLabs OBS has yet to pick up the presence of this camera even through various moments that the computer does. Should the camera be able to hook up through just the HDMI from camera to computer? Because it didn't even detect it when doing that. I also tried other software ""digicam"" that picked it up ONE time and then never again... Not sure what I did there. It was there and before I could click it, it was gone and hasn't shown up since.

Third, I got a Mini B 5 Pin cable to USB-A that was the first for the computer to detect it and ask what actions I wanted to use for it. (The cable is too short too so I was wondering if there was a type of extension cable for that or if I just have to find a longer one) The problem with this was the StreamLabs OBS STILL wont recognize the camera as a viable ""Video Capture Device"" to select.

I think that covers it all.... I am officially unraveled two different balls of yarn that are software and hardware and entangled them so much that I'm not sure what the solution may be. Any help would be appreciated! Thank you",streaming,1587244676,scarlaac17,1,1,True,2020-04-18

I'm using StreamlabsOBS and I used the optimizer, I have the VR plugin working, capped the framerate of Beat Saber to 60, checked bandwith and upload speed is perfectly fine, CPU usage is somewhat high (caps around 80%) but not crippling... I don't know what else to try really so if anyone has any recommended settings, presets, I'd be willing to give them a go as after 3/4 hours of trying to get this looking good I'm tearing my hear out aha.

590,My guide to self promotion,"Advertising is everything on twitch. Sure you might get a few views out of the blue but most viewers come with the use of smart advertising. Here is my ultimate guide to advertising to the maximum, remember to be considerate of how and where you advertise as advertising in the wrong place can be rude and you might get in trouble for it. 

Discord
1.) Enable streamer mode. Enabling streamer mode with discord enabled will show that you‚Äôre live on twitch as long as you link your twitch account under the connections tab on discord! 

2.) Self promotion channels. A lot of servers have a self promotion text channel that you can post your twitch account when you go live.

The old tv/ttv method
This method is hated amongst many but it still seems effective (specifically in most competitive shooters) just beware for stream snipers cause this will just ask for them. Changing your name in game to your username on twitch + TTV or TV (before or after your username) will guarantee people to come into your stream after getting a few kills in a game or sometimes even dying in a game. If you are playing a competitive ranked based game stream delay is recommended with this method. Don‚Äôt be afraid to try different games. 

Other streams
1.) Be careful here, you‚Äôre not going to go on another stream on twitch and directly say ‚Äúcheck out my stream and follow me‚Äù. You want to grow into a small community of smaller streamers on twitch and gain their trust and friendship which might help you out in the future. Good bonds can help you get followers, views, hosted, or even raided. 

2.) Join a twitch team. Twitch teams are actively recruiting streamers just as long as you fit their team. Be sure to check your email for a team invite because even I missed a team invite and regret it. 

3.) Stream with other streamers. Streaming with others is a way to grow both you and a friend‚Äôs channel, just make a nightbot/streamlabs command that brings a link to one another‚Äôs channel to help promote each other. 

Reddit
There are a few subreddits such as r/twitch_startup and r/twitchstreams to help advertise as well!

HD Pro looks like just a card to input into your PC and HD60s looks like portable stuff. I think first one should be better in terms of quality.

46,Shameless Stream Drop /introduction," [https://www.twitch.tv/sir\_kipzy](https://www.twitch.tv/sir_kipzy) 

Hi my name is Eric,   


I'm 28 years old and I've been playing video games for most of my life obviously as would anyone my age, recently I've been on quite the loss streak and I'm starting to feel the waves of depression that comes with living. I've recently lost just about everything I've been working at for the past 8 years.  I know I sound like I'm begging for attention and I might be but I'm sorry I just felt I had to add something about my life in this to feel less disingenuous.

   I know things are really hard right now for everyone and I wish you guys good luck on you quarantines. Come drop by if you guys ever feel like you need someone to talk to about anything, I'm not a therapist but I can defiantly drop some advice if ever needed, I'd also be glad to take any advice as well, need it be on the stream or in game or irl,  I'll do my best to entertain you :) 

I stream Warzone/CoD, OW, League, TFT, you know whatever I can get my grimy little grubs on lol, I'm just trying to make myself the best of me, stay clean out there guys it's getting pretty wild. 

Thanks for reading whoever cared enough to get this far.

My current setup is i5 9600k overclocked at 5ghz, 1.35v.
Gpu is gtx Geforce 1660 evga, 16gb rams 2666mhz.

The thing is this- just tried to turn on the fortnite and even with the lowest settings, my cpu was under 100% load while streaming 1080p 60fps. For sure 60fps is really important to me due to the nature of fps games.

I wanted to ask you- with this kind of setup, how and what should I do to have my fps games at 60fps stable and me experiencing fluidity while playing? What settings can I play around with, what should I reduce, what takes a toll on cpu and why fortnite is so heavy on my cpu? Pubg isn't even that heavy on the cpu with ultra settings as fortnite on lowest even when I have, I'd say, quite a strong cpu.

I'd love to be under 100% of cpu so that it still has room to breathe, fps are stable, performance does not stutter and viewers could experience fluid gameplay.",streaming,1586383634,iNhab,0,1,True,2020-04-08

As you probably read in the title, I'm trying to set up everything to be able to stream games and stuff through Twitch. 

I have a pretty capable PC with an i7 9700k, Asus GTX 2080 Super OC (but the GPU isnt overclocked yet), 16gb ram and a 100Mbps ethernet connection, BUT for some reason my stream Lags pretty often, about every 5 seconds. I've tried watching my stream in different devices and also friends of mine in other countries have tried to and everyone has the same problem. It keeps lagging.

Im using OBS 25.0.4, with all my drivers up to date, and I've tried using different configurations but it only makes it worse. 

As far as the settings go, I'm running the advanced settings that Nvidia recommends to use for OBS, taking advantage of the NVENC (also tried the simple settings). Also I game in a 1440p monitor but I'm trying to stream in 1080p, I've tried to stream in 1440p but it only made the problem worse.  And on top of all this, as I game I was expecting a 10 fps drop when streaming (based on friends with very similar PC's as mine which only get the 10fps shortage) but instead, for example, Vanilla GTA V online jumps from 135/140fps to 80/90fps which is quite a lot considering that technically NVENC should be running separately and shouldn't affect the gaming experience.

What I'm looking for is for someone that could potentially toubleshoot my problem and give me some advice on how to fix this. Should I lower my game settings? I'm running everything maxed out.

Anyways, I'm sorry for boring you with all this but I'm trying to fix this and i cant find any good info in google. I hope someone here has an answer and can help me with this.

Don‚Äôt need anything insane but if there was a way I could organize a raid of his stream, either through myself or though a larger streamer raiding him for his birthday it would make his bday insane. 

I know there‚Äôs is a lot more serious things going on now but I‚Äôm just trying to bring a little joy to whoever I can so figured I‚Äôd try, we‚Äôre all just staying at home nowadays anyhow :p

Much love and Let me know if anyone has any info or whatnot that could help me out!

I haven't streamed in over a year (I think) and I was wondering if there was a good streaming site that'd be easier to build a small viewership base on. Is streaming to twitch just the best idea? Or are there other sites that any of you prefer or had any success on?

I figured I might really give streaming another genuine shot. It'd be a great chance these next few months since I have not much better to do.

Does anyone also have any tips on how I could potentially get my streaming off the ground? And somehow get an average viewership? (Like any. Even if it's just 2-3 active viewers/chatters a stream.) That'd make me happy and keep me really motivated to continue.

I also watch a fair amount of twitch and see streamers have overlays, putting up information, showing multiple camera angles (face and controller for speedrunners for example) and was interested to do that in teaching calls as well.

Put up a camera on a whiteboard, one at me when I'm in front of the PC, put up information about specific exercises from a browser/notepad/etc. - an arrangement of windows and information their information.

Which makes me wonder, if there is software that lets you put together a screen to stream that. So far, I tried Streamlabs OBS, which most streamers I watch use, with which I can only stream to twitch or other services like that. If I didn't overlook anything.

What I would need, ideally, is a program that processes what I need and lets me use that as a virtual camera feed to use in the call. There was some software included with my logitech webcam that does that, but it's just adding effects and not exactly that fits my needs.

Before I invest in the hardware I want to make sure my internet is good enough.

Right now I‚Äôm having trouble with my wifi, it rarely connects to my phone (Always seems to be on 3G) and my laptop can barely get through an episode on Netflix. There are a lot of other devices in the house with other family members, and I‚Äôm sure the fact that a lot of people are staying at home right now doesn‚Äôt help. 

I want to learn how to improve my streaming experience by having a better internet speed, and from what I‚Äôve learnt I need to have a certain mbps. I have no idea how to check that; I‚Äôve seen some sites online but they all look pretty spammy. Then when I do find out my upload/download speed/mbps, how can I improve this? Can it even be improved? I also know you can plug your pc into a the router but I don‚Äôt really understand that either.

Hey Guys, I am a yogateacher from Germany and I am teaching online yoga classes. As of now, to circumvent livestream takedown and also German music industry licensing payments, I want my students to listen to their own spotify, but also be in cotrol of their playlist. 

There is this spotify web app JQBX, a social music streaming service that utilizes spotify's api to control their real life music listening experience. 

It basically has no delay, once you sync up the listening. Here is the problem:

If everyone is listening to their spotify without delay, my cues will be off-beat, because of the 3 second (youtube ultra low latency) video stream delay.

I am trying to figure out how I would be able to livestream band performances, running my 16 channels into Reaper, mixing and adding EQ, Compression etc.... and streaming the Stereo Audio WITH plugins with the Webcam video.... 

I have a Focusrite Saffire 8pre interface lightpiped with a Presonus Digimax FS 8pre for 16 total. My DAW is Reaper.     


SO FAR, the only way I could figure it out is to have the tracks going into Reaper with effects, as if I am about to record the session, then route the affected audio through the headphone jack into my phone and go live that way..... Understandably, this is limited, as I would have to rely on my phone as the camera, and it only accepts Mono in through the jack..... There has to be a BETTER WAY!!!

24,Streaming for a Funeral,"Hi all,

As the title would suggest, I'm looking for the best way to stream a funeral. Obviously this is a private event so I'm looking to stream it from a phone to a private URL that I can send to my grandad's friends that cannot make the event due to the current climate.

It'll be a short event and I'm looking to broadcast from my phone.

I've had very little experience with Twitch, would it do things like adverts? The last thing I want is that sort of thing to pop up during the service. It seems like a good idea as I can just send a URL out and the people can connect if they want to watch (assuming I can make it private). The audience obviously won't want to stream themselves back, which is why I don't think something like one of the party/meetings would be a good idea unless there's an option to not connect webcam etc when signing in.

Also, due to the generation's age, it might be best to keep it as simple as possible, so I can send them ""hey, click on this link and watch"" and that's all they need to do.

Am I unaware of any hidden gems?

36,Advice on how to block radio waves,"I don't know how weird this is going to be, so here goes.

My neighbor is a CB radio enthusiast and has built a significant radio antenna on his house. It works great. I know this, because my microphone arm picks up it all day long. I have a Blue Yeti and the headphones are plugged into the jack on the microphone. His broadcasts filter through to my headphones.

I could unplug my headphones from the microphone and plug it into the computer, which could help, but I know for a fact that his signal is still picked up and transmitted through applications like Discord. I have yet to hear it picked up on my streams or recordings, thankfully.

Does anyone have any experience with this? Any advice on how to shield nearby radio communications? With my desk setup not having the monitor arm isn't really an option, and besides I would rather my hobby not have to change because of someone else's. Likewise I'd rather not have to ask him to stop doing what he's doing.

I'm setting up a new video streaming solution for my church using discarded parts from my work. I have 5 ptz cameras going into 5 separate makito video encoder cards - putting out 5 video streams to my network. I have them all set up and and working in OBS. My issue is that if I set the cameras all to their highest resolution (1080i), I am maxing out my CPU. The computer I'm using is a donated i5 3rd gen (4 core) with 16GB of RAM and no aftermarket video card. My question is - can this PC be upgraded to support these demands? Would a video card help this problem, or is that strictly a CPU task? For reference, each stream is about 6Mbps, so a total of 30Mbps of video is coming into the PC.

I garnered a pretty large listener base, but due to the quarantine, I can't access the studio. I wanted to shift it online, but unfortunately, most sites (Twitch, etc.) do not allow copyrighted music.

Does anyone know of a good method to stream the show? I know YouTube will claim my video (which I don't mind at all) and actually pay artists royalties, which I very much appreciate. Does IG Live take down your streams or put restrictions on/take down your account for streaming copyrighted music? Is YouTube an acceptable platform? Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can continue this show remotely? Is anyone here versed in copyright law and can help me figure out the technicalities of things like Section 107 of the Copyright Act and fair use for commentary purposes?

If nothing works out, I guess I can move to exclusively commentary (no music,) but that will thoroughly detract from the point of the show.

Me and my wife recently started streaming (about 2 weeks in). Thought we would add some fun around getting to affiliate so we had a race.

Safe to say I got destroyed, she hit it on her last stream with me 15 follows behind (I also had friends that followed me where she basically built 50 from scratch).

Super proud but I need to catch up now.

I play mainly rocket league at the moment and she plays mainly DBD.

I am a 19 year old student trying to find a passion in life by trying all kinds of things. I have been playing games since I was 7 years old and I currently study indie game development. I like to stream because I want to help people out and talk to some people and have a community (chat calls me gay and a simp, but it's fine (i swear)). I stream everyday from 7pm onwards on weekdays and 5pm onwards on weekends (Brussels time GMT+1). I believe doing what I do now, where I help people in return I get a viewer/maybe follower is a good ""trade"" deal and a win win for both parties :). After I would be exposed to more people, the people that enjoy me for me can watch my other streams where I play different games, that would be the dream!

I am using TeamSpeak 3 and  discord   also other   voice over IP  programs  on my  gaming computer.

I like to hear my voice  on the  streaming PC  but not continuously  having my microphone open this is not fun to hear for the audience  and is also not ideal for me because I might  get a phone call  for instance,  so  push to talk  is really  important for me  to get this to work  on a  duo  computer setup.

&amp;#x200B;

so far I tried multiple things  already.

Like  plugging in a  secondary microphone  into the streaming PC.

First problem is  push to talk becomes hard because the keyboard is not nearby  second problem  the sound is not in sync  so having two microphones is not a solution.

I also tried connecting  both  microphones  to the gaming PC  and using a third party

software to do the push to talk this was less than ideal  the push to talk basically failed.

I also had another problem   I could only stream over a single microphone stream from my gaming computer  so it became awkward when  I am talking on TeamSpeak  you cannot hear me on The  streaming computer.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anybody know a solution  where I can  duo link a keyboard over my  LAN network ?

158,Help required. Game capture device causing game lag on source device (not 2nd screen),"Hello and thanks for reading. Looking for any help or advice on the following issue.

I have a gaming laptop for playing my games on, and a 2nd PC set up for streaming that has my Webcam, Mic and Streamlabs running on it. 

I connect them using an Avermedia game capture device plugged into the HDMI out port on my laptop.

Now, the second I plug the HDMI cable into the laptop port, I get instant game lag on my laptop. Whilst it happens with every game, the easiest to test and the most effected game is COD Warzone. I have the option to display my ping in the top corner while playing Warzone, i can sit and plug the HDMI cable in and out of my laptop and my ping display will go from 30ms to 100ms instantly and back again instantly as i plug in and out. 
This happens whether I have my stream online or offline. As long as the capture card is on and capturing my laptops screen, it lags, the second I switch it off or pull the cable it goes back to normal. 

Im assuming this might have something to do with strain on the graphics card having to display the game on my laptops screen and send it down the hdmi cable to the capture card. Can anyone advise how to test this or help smooth it out? 

Game capture device is the Avermedia LGP LITE GL310

Laptop is HP Omen i7-700HQ 2.8GHz
24GB Ram
GeForce GTX 1050

179,New streamer,"Hello everyone. This will be kind of a long post but if anyone could help me this it would be appreciated. 

I want to become a streamer. In the past i have done streaming and I do understand how streamlabs and some other streaming software work (im no expert though), the problem for me has always been raw power.

I used to have an i7 7700HK, 16gb ram and a gtx 1060 laptop which was great for gaming alone but whenever i tried to stream the output was near terrible, blurrynes everywhere and 15fps at most. Of course after lowering the resolution and other setting in the game the stream came out much better but I never felt comfortable doing that.

This gets to my question and the main reason Im asking here... I have since sold that laptop and have saved money for a really great desktop BUT is it really worth it to have a great desktop for streaming?

Let me explain a little more about the idea i have; since i have a 1080p monitor I dont really intend on doing 4k gaming at all, so 4k streaming is also not going to happen. 
So for playing 1080p 120+ fps i could go for a RTX 2060 super and a ryzen 7 3700x but then again, when I decide to start streaming the output might not be good, at all, so i started thinking about a powerfull intel i9 or ryzen 9 and a RTX 2070super at the very least... It should be much better, i know that can work but the question is: is this really optimal?

Could I go for a 2060 super for my dektop and buy a laptop with a good  cpu (no gpu), an i7 9750h for example and stream from the desktop to the laptop woth a capture card and then stream directly from the laptop to twitch, youtube or any streaming platform? 

The question is, how good is a cpu only for streaming when it is not being used for anything else? Would it be better than nvec 2 on a RTX 2070 for example?

Whenever I try to stream Apex Legends from my gaming pc and try to use medium or slow x264 encoding on 1080p streaming resolution, I get a very laggy laggy stream, like it's not even close to functioning. The stream just jumpes frames from one to the other with about 5-10sec between them.

QUESTION: Please let me know if there are any special command line I should add in that section of obs so it can work on slow or medium or if it's just not possible to stream with this kind of setup at slow x264 encoding preset.

1. What would be the best platform/service to do it on?
2. Would I have difficulties keeping videos up due to property rights? - That being the case I would be looking for the best service just to stream on and not keep a video up afterwards.

Frankly I have no clue if anyone would be interested but even if I was reading aloud for one person I would do it and it would mean a lot just to let some others make use of what I am reading, especially to interact with others during these times.

253,How to stream my own youtube playlist for my friends in quarantine?,"So here's the deal...

THE BACKGROUND:

Last week Beatport put on an exquisite live YouTube concert stream last week where good DJs played jams all night. During this live broadcast, me and my friends were having a Zoom dance party because of social distancing. It was a lot of fun, and I want to do it again tonight/this weekend. 

The only issue is that there are a few live streams going on this weekend which, in my (and my friends') opinion\[s\], is trash (YOLO EDM biiitchhh!!). 

THE QUESTION:

I know of many existing pre-recorded live sets that I would like to live stream for myself and my friends so that we can have an analogous night as last week (Zoom dance party). 

Here is what I have thought of so far (in order of desirability):

1) download the YouTube videos and stream it over another platform - whereby everyone is synced and jammin to the same music/video.

2) Stream it over the same platform as the video chat. I suspect this will cut down the audio/video quality significantly.

3) Have everyone press play at the same time on a specific video while on the video chat.

&amp;#x200B;

Please help me out. One caveat, I tried to do the pre-recorded video live chat over YouTube Live, but apparently YouTube Live has a 24 hr hold before I can stream live.

380,Canon G12 Powershot as webcam capture card and port questions,"Hello,

I have some questions about using my dslr as a webcam.

Not sure if this is the right place for the question but here goes:

  
I inherited a Canon G12 powershot and I wanted to use it as a webcam.

My EVGA GTX 1660 has only one display port and one hdmi port. I currently have my monitor into my hdmi port so I am going to put my monitor as display and use the micro hdmi to hdmi and put it in my gpu.

My motherboard has a hdmi in but I think it would be better to keep it to the gpu?

I was then going to use the some software to capture live and use that. 

I don't think I need a capture card, do I? 

My specs: 

AMD Ryzen 5 2600X 3.6 GZ CPU  
EVGA GTX1660 Super GPU  
G.SKILL 16GB D4 3000 RGB RAM  
Asus ROG Strix B450F motherboard

509,"Technical Breakdown Discussion: Hamilton ""live"" on SGN Youtube with John Krasinski","Hello there, just checking my thinking on this because I'm almost 100% sure that, SGN already being pre-recorded, that the Hamilton musical piece was almost (if not) entirely pre-recorded. Just checking my thinking here and happy to hear about apps/hardware that are available that are tackling that kind of functionality.  

Here's what I think happened.  Love to see what you think and get your thoughts. None of this, mind you, taking anything away from a wonderful and uplifting act of kindness on everyone's part.  Just dissecting the ""movie magic"" of it all: 

I believe the little girl was pre-recorded on a live call with John/Emily (and Lin-Manuel) then then John screenshared the pre-edited performance of the Hamilton cast. It is conceivable, but not likely, Lin was live performing (although his camera position changes between talking and performing clips a bit). If Lin-Manuel was live he only had to stay in sync with everything else pre-recorded.  If he was not live, it's easy to see how they could cut away to his pre-recorded performance from his same home-office location. Notice that only a handful of performers are around at the end of that to say goodbye to the little girl...could all have been canned with her reaction being recorded in the zoom with John, Emily and Lin-Manuel.

Still a magical reaction by the young lady to a cool performance but simply not live.  To my knowledge this is just not possible with current consumer tech and probably not something that could be achieved due to latency. It could possibly be achieved with a high-end wired solution but that would require some significant hardware at every performers end.  It's far more likely each performer submitted a performance to the same musical track and was told the girls name to say goodbye to at the end.  Notice how there's only a handful of performers left at the end?

8,Question on streaming to youtube,"I have been working with a local church to give them the ability to live stream their services. Got to do the first stream on Sunday, but noticed a couple of things.

The biggest thing was in YouTube studio where the preview of the stream is, if I muted it there it would mute the actual stream. I wanted to monitor the audio of the stream through obs, but because of this I had to monitor it via youtubes preview. I also tried muting the browser in windows volume mixer, but this again muted the actual streams audio. I surly must be doing something wrong, I shouldn't have to listen to the stream preview on YouTube in order for the audio to work.

Second, I'm use to streaming to twitch. There I can just hit start streaming on obs and it's live. Is there anyway to not have to hit go live within YouTube as well? I would like to make things easier for the people that will be running the stream when I'm no longer there.

12,Hey guys! I‚Äôm streaming League of Legends live! Twitch.tv/butternutzlol,"Hello Reddit! Butternutz here! I am primarily a League of Legends streamer :)

If you're interested in honing your skill set along with me or hanging out with some cool people, then you've come to the right place! I try to use each game as an opportunity to learn from mistakes, earn more game knowledge, and be a more reliable teammate.

I started playing LoL seriously again at the beginning of Season 9 when I decided to try out streaming! My relatively new streaming community has cheered me on my roller coaster of a climb up to a peak of Diamond 3. I am currently sitting at Rank #13 in NA on Vi in Diamond 4, and I'm still climbing the ranks quickly! If I'm not in the mood or mindset to play ranked, you will most likely find me playing Normals with friends/followers having fun while trying to grind Mastery 7 for different champions, we would love to have you join!

Attitude is key! I have been playing since Season 1 -- if I've learned anything, it's that there's a propensity for players to act toxic towards one another while blaming everyone else but themselves. Nobody in the universe benefits from engaging in a toxic chat. We're all human, nobody is perfect, and nobody has ever played a perfect game of League -- not even Challenger players. One of my favorite pieces of advice I've ever received is this: ""It's better to minimize mistakes than to maximize plays."" People want to be the all-star play maker... yet it's much easier to be that all star for your team if you simply focus on the things that you can control, and stay calm. For example... not missing last hits, executing proper wave control, playing safe if you don't know where the enemy jungler is, etc. I've played with a few Master+ players, and they all have one thing in common when they play -- they don't take unnecessary risks. Be patient with one another, give each other benefit of the doubt, and remember this is a team game. Empowering your teammates while keeping everyone tilt-proof makes will make the game more fun, more winnable, and YOU a much more valuable teammate! If you share that belief, I'd love to meet you!

I'm here to provide fun and entertaining content for everyone! Your feedback is always welcome so that I can continue to grow as a direct result of knowing what you want to see. I'm trying to build a community of people who are playing to have fun, and I hope that in doing so I can continue to stream full time with your support. Come join the family!

\- Removing the Zoom Driver and restarting

\- Changing the buffer size and sample rate making sure its matched

\- Installing latest firmware on Zoom

\- Trying different webcam applications

When I restart my laptop and immediately turn on the camera it works fine for a little while and then the issue returns.

52,I‚Äôve had something on my mind..,"Is there anything or anyway to get some kind of kickstart? I‚Äôve always wanted to play games and have a following of people. A way to make money and entertain people and give them a place to hang out and make friends. Give people a way to express themselves and be apart of something. I want to stream and I‚Äôm nearly $400  away from my pc being complete, but it‚Äôs like I know I‚Äôm not going to explode overnight. I know I‚Äôm not going to grow like I want to. 

I‚Äôm just trying to think of ways that I can grow quickly where I can make a living (same as I make now) and give back to people. I‚Äôve always wanted to do more than the average person. Right now I work with a phone company and I‚Äôm honestly not happy, I can feel myself getting worse by the day. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt want to work it‚Äôs just I‚Äôm not happy doing what I do. I want to make people laugh, I want to donate to charity, I want to do 24 hour events, I want to have a small audience that loves my content. There is so much I want, but what if I‚Äôm not good enough, what makes me different from the other 9,999,999 streamers? I‚Äôm scared that it‚Äôs going to fall through and I‚Äôll remain where I am, or stuck at some other job I don‚Äôt like.

I guess this has been more of a rant, but I guess I‚Äôm looking for answers or personal experience. Apart of me wishes some company can sponsor me or give me a shove. I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs what every other streamer wants. I don‚Äôt even want like STREAMER money I would just like enough to feed myself, pay the bills, and saving money. I just don‚Äôt know if what I want can be a reality. I figured with the quarantine this would be a good time to jump in. I guess I‚Äôm just looking for answers or personal experiences and maybe some tips. Please let me know your thoughts. This isn‚Äôt scripted so this is out of my head, I‚Äôm just upset right now and looking for a way to make myself feel better and give a place for others to feel better when they need it to.

I sometimes stream on twitch. I use the built in PS4 stream option and my built in mic from my HyperX cloud alpha (the red one) Headset. I'd like to get better equipment, but as I'm a student I want to make sure to invest in the right places, to get the most bang for my buck.

Obviously, my voice is, besides my gameplay, the most important asset. I was wondering, if stand alone mics really make that much of a difference, compared to the HyperX headset, which I feel is already quite good.

I'm considering to buy the AntLion mod mic, as I can plug that directly into my Headset, and don't need to also buy a capture card.

135,An interesting problem that requires some help with a creative solution,"Okay. This is gonna sound REALLY odd to ask, BUT, I need help from someone who plays on Xbox, has an Elgato HD60S, and has a wired controller. I have an issue with being unable to capture my Xbox Party Chat on my stream. Normally this wouldn't be an issue, but its a HIGHLY requested feature from my viewers and I'm trying to get it for them, the issue is that I cannot get the chatlink to work. Not because I cannot figure out how to use it, but because when I do it creates whining feedback in my stream and annoys me and my viewers to no end.  


At PAX West 2019, I asked the guys at the Elgato booth why this was and they explained to me that their chatlink can only be effectively used with a wireless controller or a grounded system - which the Xbox One (any version) isn't - and using it on a non-grounded system creates the static feedback I get when using the chat link with my wired controller on my Xbox. With my electronic communications background, it makes sense.   


Unfortunately, I need a workaround. And like I said, one of the biggest requests of my viewers is to hear my party chat, which I can't do. Previously I could use the ""Output party audio to speakers &amp; headset"" setting, but if I do that now, I get a slight reverb/echo in my party chat both on the headset and via the TV speaker output, almost a robot sound (which is also captured by the video card.)

155,"Voicemeeter Issues on Dual PC Streaming - High Pitched Voices, Stuttering Audio, No Alerts","Hi everyone!

I've been streaming on Twitch for quite sometime, and I switched to dual PC a little while back. I see to be having issues with three things:

* Music playing on Spotify is stuttering, but voice chat and in game audio seem ok.
* The voices of the people I'm talking to are higher pitched than what they actually are.
* I can't hear alerts coming from my streaming PC into my gaming PC.

I can post an example of it if it's necessary. I'm just not too sure if it would be considered as advertisement so I'll leave the link out for now.

Here's my the relevant (I think) bits of my current setup:

**Gaming PC:**

* **CPU:** Intel Core i7-9700K
* **RAM:** Crucial Ballistix LT 32GB RAM
* **GPU:** ASUS 2080 SUPER Dual EVO
* **Storage:** 2x Crucial 500GB M.2 SSD
* **Mic:** Blue Yeti Blackout

**Streaming PC:**

* **CPU:** Intel Core i7-5930K
* **RAM:** 32GB Crucial Ballistix Elite DDR4-2400
* **GPU:** MSI 980 ti
* **Storage:** Samsung 850 EVO 500GB and WD Blue 1TB
* **Capture Card:** Elgato HD60 Pro

Here's how they are both set up in Voicemeeter Banana:

171,Help with audio issues during livestream attempt,"Please note: I‚Äôm new to reddit, this subreddit, and streaming in general- I apologize if this has been asked before, or if I‚Äôm missing something that may be general knowledge to most streamers! 

Hello everyone, 

I‚Äôm a musician based in Austin, Texas and this past weekend my band and I tried to livestream a performance on YouTube with some less than stellar results. I‚Äôm hoping someone here can give me a little advice because we are all brand new to streaming (as you‚Äôll likely tell from this post) and couldn‚Äôt seem to find an answer to our query on the internet, though I have a feeling that was more because we didn‚Äôt quite know how to correctly search for what was going wrong. 

We tried to do a full instrumental audio stream by running 8 microphones through a mixer, then doing a stereo mix through two XLRs into our two-input interface (a focusrite). We tested the audio in a DAW (Reaper, specifically) and it was sounding surprisingly great! However, when we attempted to livestream, the audio would sound great for the first few bars of a song and would then drop out- almost as if YouTube has a really shitty auto-limiter. It made our audio go from sounding full to almost as if you were hearing it underwater.  

We double checked our mixer and interface to make sure there was no clipping from either than may cause Audio degradation- everything was safely in the green on our end. 

At this time, our audio was simply:

Instruments &gt; mixer &gt; interface &gt; YouTube live stream 

I‚Äôm wondering if we needed to use something like OBS in between the interface and YouTube? Or maybe the issue is just YouTube? Any advice is hugely appreciated! 

You can hear what went wrong here: https://youtu.be/4cavGLZz3UU

233,Ideal upload speeds - law of diminishing return?,"Hey all,

Have never had to try to stream much of anything before this pandemic but have become responsible for it on behalf of my organization.

As we're not usually a tech heavy office the internet we've had has been acceptable, but today I called our provider and learned the internet we've been paying for is grandfathered-in *crap* and for the same price we could update to 100/10 mbs Internet.

So I shopped around and called the local competitor who said they could offer (up to) 100/100mbs fiber-op for basically the same price we're paying now.

Details aside, my question is: are higher upload speeds better when it comes to streaming, or is there a law of diminishing returns at work with this?

I plan to be streaming either through an iPhone 7, Logitech C920, or maybe Canon M50 to YouTube or Facebook. 

Would having, say 15mbs be better than 5mbs? Would 60mbs upload be bette than 10, or does the value drop off at some point? Several things I read seemed to imply that even for something like Twitch, doing 1080p at 60fps, you wouldn't need more than 10mbs upload.

I only ask because if we upgrade with our current provider the upgrade is instantaneous, whereas the competitor will have to come out and install and that might take a while.

244,Action vs OBS Streamlabs,"Hey everyone.. got a question about live streaming from each of these softwares. I like the overall functioning of OBS Streamlabs much better and find it much more versatile to stream with, however it hangs or becomes choppy if I try to stream at too high of a resolution.. I have to go to 720p and lower the bitrate before it becomes smooth, and even then it doesn't look the greatest. Even when I record a video locally through SLOBS, it kind of looks like crap.

Action, however, can record locally 1080p at 60fps with no lag, and I can even broadcast great - no hangups or stuttering.. and overall quality is better - and this is at 1080p vs 720p on SLOBS.

Wondering if anyone has any clue on why Action is so much better at this than SLOBS, and if SLOBS can be tweaked to perform better? Action came out of the box pretty much good to go.. SLOBS I've played with all the settings... tweaked bitrate, used software vs hardware encoding, downscale filters, etc... everything in the settings, I've tried, and it still doesn't compare.

Anyone else experience issues with Streamlabs OBS?",streaming,1585345519,JDorian88,3,1,True,2020-03-27

My friend has built an amazing sound system, and as such has become a very good DJ,as we have an audio output. As in, we can stream the direct audio from the decks as opposed to the camera audio.

What I invision is a video feed with the audio directly from the decks. 
I have a Canon DSLR and a smartphone. 
Is there any kind of software or other such wizardry that can marry these two together?

Is this maybe a connection issue with the long USB? Is the computer underpowered (it is but would that cause it fail like this)? Or is the camera just too old / not designed for this.

I'm trying to stream iRacing in VR from my gaming PC using an old laptop with an Elgato HD60s connected. Because iRacing in VR is already very resource heavy I'm trying to take the load off my gaming PC.

399,Help With Computer Build | Video Streaming for Church,"Hi! I'm not really into games/PC anymore, but I used to be in high school and made gaming videos. I now serve at a church and because of Covid we've had to switch to online streaming. We are a small church and as such have a small budget and had no tech to stream apart from a phone. So I pulled out my old PC and we got an Elgato capture card that goes straight into the PCIe. It worked, and we successfully went live, but had some limitations and was hard on my CPU, was running about 80% usage the whole time. So my thought was just to upgrade the CPU, but then I found out I'd also have to upgrade my motherboard. I reached out to a friend who builds PCs but thought I'd also throw it out here for a wide net of advice. We dont need the latest and greatest tech. Some parts that are a couple years old would be fine, something we can get on a budget, and helps me keep as much of my older stuff(power, RAM, case and whatever else). So if anyone could help point us in the right direction that would be awesome. 

My current build is:
CPU | AMD A8-3870
Motherboard | MSI A75MA-G55 (MS-7696)

Sort of like practicing singing and actually being on stage are two different things, I want this to be ""live"", and even if nobody listens, the idea that they might, and can come back at a later point and watch the clip, is what matters to me, because it seems to open me up to speaking from the heart and thus to learn better who I am and what I want.  


What I want for the streaming service is a space where I can play at being Alan Watts (or Narcissa Wright, perhaps? :P), to curse, fart, and say things like there is no evil, Hitler was holy, etc, without fear of being banned. I want to be able to say anything and nothing, just sit in silence, cry a bit, then laugh, and go on a rant about all the ways in which I don't practice what I preach. So yeah, a space where I can just sit for hours and talk (with video), freely, and then save those streams on the site for people (but mostly me, probably, because since I'm good at preaching but worse at practicing, I've come to the conclusion that I should actually start listening to myself and the crazy things I say because they hold keys to deep truths, pains, and love, for me) to watch at a later occasion.

435,Free and Open Source Multicamera Remote Setup for OBS - ALMOST THERE BUT...,"Hello!

Over the past week, I‚Äôve been working towards a free, open source solution to bring multiple remote cameras sourced from mobile devices into OBS and out to the world, and, I‚Äôm close.

The issue is lag in YouTube - latency - and I‚Äôm looking for advice on how best to optimise HLS parameters and other backend variables.

I followed [https://blog.wmspanel.com/2015/08/larix-broadcaster-live-streaming-setup.html](https://blog.wmspanel.com/2015/08/larix-broadcaster-live-streaming-setup.html:) :

\- I installed Larix Broadcaster on a series of phones (all remote and not on my LAN)

\- I set up a Nimble Streamer with a friend in a different country

\- I have each instance of Larix on each phone input rtmp://(MY IP):2021/live/cam1

\- Nimble then automatically received rtmp://(MY IP):2021/live/cam1 as an outgoing stream, and gave me an HLS playlist - http://(MY IP):8081/live/cam1/playlist.m3u8

\- I created a Media Source in OBS, put in the HLS playlist URL, and, it worked!

**The outcome:**

\- I found toggling down Larix to 500kbps and 640x480 made a difference for smoother OBS ingestion

\- I also found setting my HLS chunk duration and count to 2 and 6 helped

\- I found about a 6-7 second delay when I checked the RTMP stream in VLC (far better than SRT)

**The problem:**

\- The last mile - from OBS on my laptop to YouTube - is awful

\- Serious lag, blocky video, and generally just not usable

**I think I need to:**

\- tweak things like HLS chunk and duration in Nimble

\- perhaps also enable interleaving compensation and Apple‚Äôs Low-Latency HLS (both are Nimble Server options globally)

\- maybe my laptop that can‚Äôt handle OBS taking up 90% of my CPU power

\- find a better server solution - maybe the fact that the server is across the Atlantic Ocean is a problem

I am using a Canon Vixia HF R800  connected to an Elgato HD 60s. This all runs into my Lenovo Yoga 710  with the 2.7ghz i5-7200 and 8gb RAM as I use Streamlabs 0.20.2. My upload speed ranges from 75mbps  to 90mbps.

I am streaming public speakers and performers. Can anyone help me out with best settings?",streaming,1585616181,Sherauditor,0,1,True,2020-03-30
469,Streaming Modded Minecraft,"I created a custom modpack with some really interesting mods! We have so far created a bread factory that creates dough and makes bread from that dough. Might not sound interesting, however, the mod create has some really cool interesting blocks for automation much like immersive engineering.

I'm currently trying out mixer; however, this might change.

My schedule is currently **everyday from 4pm - 11pm** *CST* on Mixer.
