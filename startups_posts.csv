[1]

The key proposition was that it‚Äôs possible to survive and if you‚Äôre resourceful enough, even thrive.

Boy oh boy... that went down about as well as showing up naked to prom night,
covered in baby oil screaming ‚Äòthey‚Äôll never catch me‚Äô.

Well, we‚Äôre a month down the line and the results are in. There absolutely are businesses that have been able to use this situation to their advantage and massively grow their bottom line. 

(Hopefully, some of those people have adjusted their decision making framework accordingly but something tells me certain people are more motivated by a negativity circle-jerk than optimizing for finding the truth.)

BUT, and it‚Äôs a big but, it did require a total reassessment of the business model.

Some companies just lucked out, zoom, netflix, the consumer bread baking industry, board game makers, instacart, doordash etc. But relying on hope makes for a poor strategy. 

So questions need to be asked:

What‚Äôs my new value proposition? What‚Äôs my new user base? What‚Äôs my delivery channel? My vendors? My revenue stream? Or we talking about a pivot? Or are wel talking about a fundamentally different business? And so on.

In that thread there was a clear separation between positive minded people and negative minded ones. (It‚Äôs easier to complain than to to come up with solutions.)

E.g. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not spending money therefore no one is spending money‚Äù type of logic (False Consensus effect in social psychological terms.) (Pelham, 2019).

I suspect the former are people that run real companies (forced out of necessity to overcome their emotions and come up with solutions) while the latter are probably only studying (no skin in the game), but that‚Äôs merely a hypothesis.

The key takeaway is that: Being a founder is hard enough! Do not let your mind become an extra hurdle to overcome. 

A comedian has 1 job, get on stage and make people laugh.

In the same vein a founder has 1 job, figure out what people will give you money for and then give it to them in exchange for money. 

The people that are mindlessly executing a business model aren‚Äôt founders. [2] That‚Äôs not good or bad, it just is. Those people are useful when the business is essentially nothing more than keeping the revenue engine running. [3]

But when the entire macro environment shifts, it‚Äôs creatives that you need. People that are comfortable with uncertainty. Or at least willing to act despite being uncomfortable.

So here‚Äôs the TLDR: The environment has shifted drastically. Do NOT let this opportunity go to waste. If damage control is the best you can do right now, do damage control. But perhaps it‚Äôs possible to thrive, although it will take some creativity and balls. And lastly, your mindset matters. It‚Äôs clich√© as hell, but self-fulfilling prophecies are a thing. So hang around people you look up to and ax nihilistic defeatist people out your life.

[2] At Youngling &amp; Feynman we call them entrepreneurs because we make a distinction between the execution of the business model vs the discovery of it. It‚Äôs important to realize that the former is easily replaced, either by someone cheaper or by software. Any time something has a very high degree of repetitiveness and a formulaic quality to it you run that risk.
