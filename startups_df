1,MY BRAND NEED HELP,"Hello. My name is Vasco Ferreira and I am a young entrepreneur who lives in Portugal. I created a clothing brand made of 100% plastic from the oceans and the price tag we usually put in the trash is biodegradable and has a seed from a tree or medium plant for the customer to plant. If he doesn't have the possibility, he can always ask us to plant for him. As I started from scratch I need to gain investment and more recognition because here in Portugal it is very difficult. We are on Instagram as @welp_the_movement. We really need help because it is a brand with a lot of potential but it urgently needs legs to walk.

4,"What does a non-technical cofounder need to bring to the table in order to move from ""idea guy"" to ""legit potential partner""","I'm thinking in the context of a bootstrapped startup, here.

I'm actually pretty technical - I'm just not a hacker, in the code sense. I won't go into the details of what I'm looking to do as I'm not really looking to solicit a cofounder at this point, I just really want to know exactly what a talented and maybe hungry tech-side cofounder would want to see (beside a huge pile of money) in order to be enticed to join a project.

Are there any specific things you're looking for, or red flags you're looking to avoid?

Does a ""non-technical"" cofounder actually having technical chops help with this relationship?

When it comes time to look out for someone, again, I don't want to be the ""idea guy"", I want to bring my best to the table.

17,dilemma about CAD design for injection molding,"Hi all,

First time trying to get an injection molded part for my product and I have two dilemmas.

1) On one hand I don't want to waste money on CAD design for injection molding if the specific design mold will cost too much to justify using injection molding. On the other hand I can't estimate what the injection mold will cost without providing the firms a CAD design first. I tried providing photos instead of similar molded parts but the reps reasonably explained it was not enough to provide an estimate. What to do?

2) The molded parts are for a bluetooth speaker. I can get the inner part CAD designed since I already know where each electronical part goes and how it is attached to the case, but for the design of the outside part of the case there's also a dilemma. I want it to look good and provide our existing product sketches to the CAD designer, however if a specific design is good from a marketing point of view but x1.2x - x2+ more expensive from an injection molding standpoint then it's not a good idea, but I see no way to determine that without having the CAD designer design it and then send it to the injection molding firms to get a quote which risks us losing money on unusable CAD design and possibly several times. What's the best approach in such a situation?

Hopefully there are common best approaches to such situations. Thank you in advance.",startups,1587465071,Glitteriide3,5,1,True,2020-04-21
18,So you plan to hire writers for your blog/content marketing to grow your startup? Here‚Äôs something you must know.,"I started as a freelancer but now running a successful writing company for the past few years. For instance, one of my recent projects was writing and leading a team of writers to produce all the content for a tech startup, at $20k/month.  

As a result, I have been at both ends of the spectrum: writer and well as employer of writers, and qualified to offer some advice which I feel can really help you. As you know, there are hundreds of places to find and hire content writers:

* Freelance marketplaces (Fiverr, Upwork etc.)
* Remote job sites (Flexjobs, Virtual Vocations etc.)
* Social Media (Facebook groups, LinkedIn search etc.)
* Google (Search freelance finance writer, for example)
* Writing job boards (Problogger, Freelance Writing Gigs etc.)

**But your chances of finding a writer who can actually write the kind of content required for successful content marketing/blogging are next to nil.** 

# Here‚Äôs why:

* No matter where you post your requirements, you will get hundreds of applications, 99% of which are mediocre writers. It‚Äôs going to take forever. 
* Your budget is peanuts. You‚Äôre looking for a good and affordable and fast content writer, but at less than 5-6 cents/word. 
* Your idea of good content is just that it should have the correct English language, and pass the Copyscape test. 
* You don‚Äôt have the time or expertise to check whether the writer is actually delivering content better than what‚Äôs already available on other sites. 
* You think publishing average quality content is still better than publishing no content. 

In fact, let me tell you what‚Äôs actually happening in the industry. 99% of writers don‚Äôt know jack about writing good content, even the ones who charge high rates. 

Don‚Äôt believe me? Let me tell you about my little experiment to see if there is a difference in quality of work of cheap and expensive content writers. 

# My Hiring Experiment

Since I am in the writing business, I am always looking for talented writers. So a few weeks back I hired 3 content writers with different rates. I found them mostly through freelance marketplaces and Google search.

All of them were experienced and had been writing for clients for 3+ years. I gave each of them a topic to write on. When they finally delivered their drafts, I was surprised to see there wasn‚Äôt much difference in the quality of work they submitted. 

One of the drafts was downright poor, the other two were decent, but none of the drafts could be called even good, forget about great. 

And I am sure this is the case with most content writers. But it doesn‚Äôt impact them because 99% clients don‚Äôt know jack about what they need to check in their work. 

So they approve it based on their own preferences/tastes regarding what they want. Clients think they are getting good content, and writers think they are writing good content. 

In both of their delusions, what gets published is poor content, and what gets hurt is business return on content spend. Why else do you think there is so much poor content being published in most business blogs? 

Since it‚Äôs just a rehash of dozens of articles already available on the same topics, it fails to rank and get any traffic. As a result, clients get frustrated and quit, thinking that this whole content marketing/blogging thing doesn‚Äôt work.

**So does that mean you‚Äôre doomed and there‚Äôs no hope? Nope! There is a way.**

* Before you start looking for a content writer, take the time to learn about content marketing and writing on your own. 
* This will not only help you to be able to assess someone‚Äôs work, but also to develop an appreciation for the craft and know what it‚Äôs worth. So you will not be looking for the cheapest writers. 
* Get serious about content marketing. Have a strategy. Do it right, or don‚Äôt do it at all. Otherwise, you‚Äôre just wasting your time and money.
* Look at other articles in your niche/industry which are ranking high in Google search results. Analyze how they are written, how long they are and what makes them great - graphics, examples, use of research data etc?

Now that you are ready to hire a content writer, I am going to tell you the best and fastest method of finding one that no has mentioned in any other answers. 

# Read Similar/Competitor Blogs

Are there any blogs which cover the same type of topics as you want to get content for? Any favorite business magazines or trade journals related to your business? Blogs of your competitors?

I am sure some names will pop up in your mind. If not, you can do a quick Google search for ‚Äútop \[niche\] blogs.‚Äù If you are into a fitness business for example, search for top fitness blogs or best health blogs. 

Now look at which of the articles written on these blogs are guest posts or contributions. These are articles not written by the blog‚Äôs staff, but by an external contributor. 

And many of these contributors are freelance writers. You can tell by looking at their bio below the article. In most cases, the bio also has a link to their website or social media profile, which you can use to contact them.      

For example, here is one of the articles I wrote for OceanWP on [how to start a blog](https://oceanwp.org/blog/how-create-wordpress-blog-2020-pros/), which shows a short bio of me at the bottom.

**Why is this the best way to find a content writer?** 

Since they managed to get published on reputed publications in your niche, you can trust that these are professional and credible writers who can write high quality content. 

Plus, from their content, you can tell they are already knowledgeable in your domain. Two birds from one stone. How about that!

Finally, I hope this was useful and you‚Äôre more knowledgeable and realistic about hiring a content writer than you were before. If you have any other questions I can help with, or just want to chat, feel free to reach out.",startups,1587466842,hiteshsahni,11,1,True,2020-04-21

Our team at ByteBeacon built a simple REST notification service for internal use where we poste updates on a slack channel.

We're almost done with a beta release for it as well, but feel there are a lot more use cases that can be addressed.

So, say you‚Äôre on an Amazon page, or another product page of a general retailer, it‚Äôll determine the product and the company that made it.  It‚Äôll then give you all kinds of information you‚Äôd want to know before deciding if you want to support that company or not.

Examples might be various ratings, latest headlines, if they took an SBA bailout and are a large corporation, where they‚Äôre located (US made?), what‚Äôs their environmental impact, etc.

Same would be the case on company websites where you‚Äôre making more direct purchases.

The benefits here are pretty obvious.  But you‚Äôd be able to more efficiently provide information to users at the time of purchase so they can make socially responsible decisions, all while holding companies responsible for their actions.

Not sure at the moment the best way to get mobile support.  A browser plugin seems the most obvious for implementation on the desktop.

This app also tracks your periods, tracks your birth control pills, gives you medical valid information about different methods of contraception, and answers your FAQs

This app is available in English, Hindi and Marathi because I didn't want ANY indian woman to miss out on knowledge just because she is not comfortable with English.

**So I've spent my own savings on this (no funding from outside, app is free and I'm getting no income from it) and wanted help figuring out ways of marketing this app to women who need it.**

73,I'm a web developer that is trying to make a creative deal for a partnership proposal. I was wondering if you guys could help?,"I've built the majority of SaaS Application on my own, but now I'm getting to the point where the rest might be too much to handle on my own. I want to try and partner with a freelancer that I was going to hire in the summer. I'm trying to make a deal. I'm hoping you guys can tell me what's what. 

I don't think there are too many web developers interested in just 50/50 partnerships and to be honest with you, I'm not interested in that because I've built too much of the project on my own. What I'm hoping to do is offer one of the following, or a combination of, one these agreements to a entice a partner:

1. Equity in project
2. A reduction in hourly costs for services. To compensate for the reduction in costs I would offer some form of royalty that runs out after an agreed upon amount. For example, the partner I am trying to entice services run at $50 an hour and I need 250 hours of services which amounts to $12,500 for the entire project. Instead of paying $50 an hour, I would offer $20 making the costs for services for the entire project $5,000, but offer a royalty at x% until $25,000. 
3. Potentially have the royalty be reclaimed for shares at the time of incorporating. 

To make it safe on their part, the agreement would only be made once I have completed my end of the application. In this case the backend and a lot of the frontend. I also understand that there will need to be viability to the project itself.

Is there any other way of going about this with limited money? Thanks.

77,A Great Leap Forward to Transform Fintech: Data Empowerment,"A Great Leap Forward to Transform Fintech: Data Empowerment


India is one of the first nations in the world to kick off Open APIs for consented financial data sharing. And nobody‚Äôs heard about it! 

Dear Kickass Financial Product Managers and (current &amp; future) Fintech Entrepreneurs,

Amidst the usual flurry of sensational headlines, you may have missed a quiet announcement a few weeks ago that marked a monumental shift: RBI became the first central bank globally to publish a common technology framework ‚Äì including detailed APIs ‚Äì for consent driven data sharing across the entire financial sector (banking, insurance, securities, and investment).

This is a gamechanger for the industry.

Out of context, yet another circular with a good deal of jargon is an easy thing to gloss over. But it turns out this effort is actually a global first: although the UK, EU, Bank of International Settlements (BIS), Canada, and others have begun thoughtful public conversations around Open Banking (e.g. through that famous BIS report making the case, initiatives like PSD2, conferences, and various committees), India is one of the first nations in the world to actually make it a market reality by publishing detailed technical API standards ‚Äî standards that are quickly being adopted by major banks and others across the financial sector in the country without a mandatory requirement from RBI. It‚Äôs not just the supposedly cutting edge banks of Switzerland, the UK, or the US driving fintech innovation: the top leadership of our very own SBI, ICICI, IDFC First, Bajaj Finserv, Kotak, Axis, and other household names have recognised that this is the way forward for the industry, and are breaking through new global frontiers by actually operationalising the powerful interoperable technology framework. Not only are they adopting the APIs, some are also starting to think through the new lending and advisory use cases and products made possible by the infrastructure. We think many new fintech startups should also be considering doing the same.

Why do the APIs Matter?

The world is focusing heavily on data protection and privacy ‚Äì and rightly so. Securing data with appropriate access controls and preventing unauthorised third-party sharing is critical to protecting individual privacy. But to a typical MSME, portability and control of their data is just as critical as data security to empower them with access to a stream of new and tailored financial products and services. For instance, if an MSME owner could share trusted proof of their business‚Äô regular historic GST payments or receivables invoices digitally with ease, a bank could now offer regular small ticket working capital loans based on demonstrated ability to repay (known as Flow-based lending) rather than just loans backed on collateral. Data sharing can become a tool for individual empowerment and prosperity by enabling many such innovative new solutions.


Operationalising a seamless and secure means to share data across different types of financial institutions ‚Äì banks, NBFCs, mutual funds, insurance companies, or brokers ‚Äì requires a common technology framework for data sharing. The published APIs create interoperable public infrastructure (a standard ‚Äòrails‚Äô) to be used for consented data sharing across all types of financial institutions. This means that once a bank plugs into the network as an information provider, entities with new use cases can plug in as users of that data without individually integrating with each bank. Naturally, the system is designed such that data sharing occurs only with the data owner‚Äôs consent ‚Äî to ensure that data is used primarily to empower the individual or small business. The MeiTY Consent Framework provides a machine-readable standard for obtaining consent to share data. This consent standard is based on an open standard, revocable, granular (referring to a specific set of data), auditable, and secure. Programmable consent of this form is the natural next innovation of the long terms and conditions legalese that apps typically rely on. RBI has also announced a new type of NBFC ‚Äì the Account Aggregator ‚Äì to serve as a consent dashboard for users, and seven new AAs already have in principle licenses. 

The Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture (DEPA) ‚Äì in one image


In many other nations, market players have either not been able to come together to agree on a common technical standard for APIs, or have not been able to kick off its adoption across multiple competing banks at scale and speed. In countries like the US, data sharing was enabled only through proprietary rails ‚Äì private companies took the initiative to design their own infrastructure for data sharing which end up restricting players like yourselves from innovating to design new products and services which could benefit people on top of the infra. 

What other kinds of innovative products and services could you build? 

Think of the impact that access to the Google Maps APIs allowed: without them, we would never have seen startups like Uber or Airbnb come to life. Building these consented data sharing APIs as a public good allows an explosion of fintech innovation, in areas such as:

New types of tailored flow-based lending products that provide regular, sachet sized loans to different target groups based on GST or other invoices (as described above). 
New personal financial management apps which could help consumers make decisions on different financial institutions and products (savings, credit, insurance, etc.) based on historic data and future projections. This could also branch out into improved wealth management or Robo advisory. 
Applications that allow individuals to share evidence of financial status (for instance, for a credit card or visa application) without sharing a complete detailed bank statement history of every transaction
‚Ä¶and many others, such as that germ of an idea that‚Äôs possibly started taking shape in your mind as you were reading.

In summary

This ecosystem is where UPI was in mid-2016: with firm, interdepartmental, and long term regulatory backing, and at the cusp of operationally taking off. UPI taught us that those who make a bet on the future, build and test early (PhonePe and Google were both at the first ever UPI hackathon!), and are agile enough to thrive in an evolving landscape end up reaping significant rewards. And just as with UPI, our financial sector regulators are to be lauded for thinking proactively and years ahead by building the right public infrastructure for data sharing. RBI‚Äôs planning for this began back in 2015! They have now passed the innovation baton onto you ‚Äî and we, for one, have ambitious expectations.

With warmest regards,

So they asked me how much I think is fair and I do believe improving their web presence as well as working on better communication between their customers and them is valuable (among many other things that can be done). However, I don't know how to approach this. 60/40 still sounds somewhat too much for me, but 70/30 or lower makes me think it feels like I work for them.

126,Cash is everywhere. But investors need clarity instead of fancy words and slides. The brief outcome from series of VCs interviews,"Hi everyone. This is the cross post from r/entrepeneur, cause I think this may be relevant for the local r/startups community even more.

I was reading a lot of posts and comments on how difficult it is to raise capital for a startup during the recession. Well, since the beginning of the lockdown my friends from InnMind accelerator were talking with globally recognized VCs from Silicon Valley and Europe, trying to clarify what is expected to happen on the VC market in general and how do investors themselves react and behave during the crisis.

The detailed report with the outcomes will be published soon. But before I summarized a few insights from the interviews with investors which differ significantly from the dust circulating in media.

**1. Investors' money didn't disappear**

Majority of big VCs (especially seed &amp; early stage) continue seeking for and considering new investment opportunities. Nothing has changed in this regards: investors are still interested in good projects. Some of them who got used to meet with founders personally have troubles in switching to online communications and decision making, but those which previously practised international investments without personal meetings have switched to 100% online mode very fast and now are communicating with founders in zoom, listening to pitches and making investment committees online.

**2. Investment deal origination process moved online**

Usually, a huge part of investment deals comes from the trusted sources/referrals, and here nothing actually changed. But also part of the deals was originated from the offline events: startup competitions, demo days, accelerators, etc. Since the lockdown started and events are over, many investors started to use dedicated online platforms more proactively and participate in online demo days (YC demo day last month had more investors watching online pitches than ever). Among commonly used platforms they mentioned Crunchbase, Angel list and InnMind.

**3. There is NO lack of investors / money. There is a lack of good projects and sane ideas pitches.**

Speaking about the investment decision and startup assessment process, all investors shared the same problem they are facing: lack of quality deal flow.  For late-stage VCs it is more or less obvious: not easy to find good startups, which found product-market fit and generated impressive traction which proves their business model. But early and seed stage investors, who are used to act in the framework with many unknowns and uncertainties, the biggest issue was... the inability of startups to deliver clear message and value proposition in their pitch deck.

For example, both Silicon Valley billionaire Tim Draper, the founder of Altair Capital Igor Ryabenkiy and many other interviewed VCs said, that in the majority of startup pitches they receive they simply fail to understand WHAT this startup is doing and HOW are they going to make money or change the world (what is often claimed).

Investors say that so many startup founders are sending decks with fancy slides and complicated wordy descriptions which move the whole thing away from the focus and the sense. Meanwhile, in the early stage when there is no proven traction and financial income yet, what is really valuable for investors is to see the clear picture of the business idea and its market potential. If the founders can't communicate it even to investors, they will most probably fail to communicate it to potential users and customers.

152,Reporting on my Quest for a Holy Grail: Missing Link in Web startup feedback/research,"&gt;!a 5-minute post to read,!&lt; *so grab a coffee, but it‚Äôs worth it; hopefully my aggravating hunt will save you guys wasted time, and in the process get me to the last mile.*  
Something I noticed ‚Äî as a prolific serial putter-outer of landing pages for potential concepts (to get a sense of initial traction and make the case for further investment of effort and seeding)‚Äî  is there is a gap in the market for a **single, globally-applicable, solution to automate legitimate visitor/user survey-response-incentivization‚Ä¶ turnkey... for early-stage ventures**. 

*Why is this ABSOLUTELY essential ?* The notion that an entrepreneur gets a magic idea and just hacks it up and it goes insanely viral without any thinking about market-uptake beforehand\* is sound, but elusive and fleeting, really a fairytale for the rest of us ‚Äî methodologically-minded, b-school-trained entrepreneurs who understand that investors want to know you know your market and its sentiment to your product, presented objectively.  
^(\*()*^(In reality early online startups have a LOT of iteration of landing-page experience for email conversion based on Feedback, but many haven‚Äôt advanced to MVP with &gt;100 monthly visitors for doing UX/UI A/B testing or data-mining their product reviews yet.))*  
Market research is key to move in the right direction. BUT also‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs proven that most visitors who come to your website from a facebook/insta ad won‚Äôt take the time to give it to you for free, so response rates are way higher for incentivized (paid) direct-reward surveys. BUT AGAIN, manually exporting survey respondent emails and buying them an Amazon card each is an admin chore none of us has time to do.

I looked at so many survey providers to funnel/journey my initial pre-launch traffic through (*think SurveyMonkey, Survio, SurveyGizmo, Nextiva, etc*) and countless Reward/Giftcard administrators. ‚ÄúInsights‚Äù statistical agencies are beyond a startup's means (Qualtrics, IPSOS, etc). Most of the Reward/Giftcard companies are scams populated by unemployed homesitters who rate mindlessly and try to game the system with multiple identities, conning you and biasing results. The few administrators that are reputable and have fraud-detection (*like Rybbon/Tremendous, not Swagbucks*) DO have entry-level scalable pricing within an upstart's reach (i.e. no-minimum pay-per-gift-disbursed not steep monthly subscription) and have seamless auto-pay integrations with survey providers‚Ä¶ YET those survey providers will only give integration features to their Enterprise customers, WAY too pricey for a new idea being pivoted. Only 1 vendor I found delivered a turnkey inhouse survey-reward-delivery service (*ProProfs*) but again, only for Enterprise.

**I‚Äôm getting closer to a solution:**   
1. I interact with attracted site traffic a bit with a fun chatbot and have a 10-minute ‚Äòpre-selling‚Äô call with them to pre-screen/filter potential respondents (and verify their real identity) to take only bona-fide, targeted, engaged visitors to a survey. This tosses out scammers and clueless people who‚Äôll never end up being part of that brand's story.  
2. I found a ‚Äògamified‚Äô survey provider called *Feedlier* that offers Partial gift-card/reward-integration for its Free plan‚Ä¶ which I can integrate with a smaller-but-still-not-seedy administrator called *GiftBit ‚Ä¶* I'd still have to make a Zapier connection between them (and full-featured reward administration thank you emails also only for their paid plan), but at least a cash-strapped idea can get started with insight-collection at low risk (my gifting outlay only skyrockets if my visitors do, at which point, I am onto a winning idea anyway which would then justify upgrading to their recurring-hit paid plan and personally funding the idea further (or fixing the catch-22 by having gained the understanding of your market's insights to raise pre-VC capital from family/friends/angels). 

Unfortunately, it still doesn‚Äôt crack it for my particular case (which is shared by a lot of entrepreneurs) because GiftBit‚Äôs reward-card portfolio looks like it‚Äôs limited to USA/Canada/Australia ‚Äî and those gift cards CAN‚ÄôT BE USED outside their issued country. Which means all my survey respondents outside these countries will hate me afterwards, because I baited them then denied them being able to claim their gift with fine-print afterwards. There is another Zapier-connected option called *TangoCard* that has a somewhat more international choice of reward/giftcards to choose from that would work for more users‚Ä¶ but its pricing isn‚Äôt transparent so I think they are only for big enterprises. 

I‚Äôm out of steam on this and really desperate for suggestions on no-code, quick solutions to affordably set up a survey with automated administration of a direct-reward incentive that works GLOBALLY. Maybe there‚Äôs a Zapier-integrated way to simply wire money to people‚Äôs email addresses (Paypal with no account?), or a Survey host that delivers some sort of digital artifact as a reward incentive for their courses that work globally (like a Udemy course credit or E-Book). As Americanized as I am it‚Äôs nonsensical and counter-revenue to keep things this way in a world now where the BULK MAJORITY of e-commerce transactions happen outside the Red White and Blue countries‚Ä¶ Companies that issue giftcards resold by Reward-administrators need to get their ostrich-heads out of the sand and figure this out. Open to ideas, discussion, share similar experiences if you‚Äôve gone through this‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs all helpful!

But at least the above is a solution for you if your early-stage online startup is limited to the USA/Canada/Australia market only.",startups,1587628423,neon_musk,4,1,True,2020-04-23

161,How the backlog issues prioritization saved the company from closure during the pandemic. Stories of launching three products.,"I first met Vitaly almost five years ago in Palo Alto when he was participating in an acceleration program at 500 Startups with a product called Concert With Me (an event recommendation service). Over the next two years, the service reached a multimillion dollar annual revenue, but then shut down due to unexpected changes in Facebook‚Äôs policies. Then the team created a new go-to-market strategy and released Tendee, a SaaS marketing automation product for the event industry. It met a product-market fit in Europe and the US and brought several large customers and reached dozens of thousands of dollars in MRR. But it had to be put on hold due to the Covid19 pandemic.

In need of a survival plan, the team decided to introduce to the world the prioritization tool they had used within the company for almost two years.

The new product led to striking results, as well as some curious realizations and insights into how sharply the experience of product development differs in conformity with the added value level and market type.

I got in touch with Vit a week ago, and he shared his story with me. It was a gripping conversation, so it occurred to us we could develop it into an article where Vitaly would share his experience in the product development process, as well as reflections on the fundamental differences between the launch of his latest backlog-grooming product ([Ducalis.io](https://hello.ducalis.io/)) and previous event marketing products.

Growth and development in a competitive market: On the importance of distribution channels and platform independenceTell me shortly about Concert With Me?

We developed a classic ticketing eCommerce platform for the western market. The product didn‚Äôt differ much from most of the usual sites selling concert and event tickets, but we had a distinctive feature in the customer acquisition model. It was the unique growth model that allowed ticket sales to rocket to several million dollars in a very competitive western market in just a few years.

What were the product-market fit conditions for Concert With Me?

The usual thing: discover a channel with cheap traffic that your competitors have missed. We managed to build a large automated system for traffic acquisition via Facebook. For the most part, it operated thanks to the hidden potential of Facebook Events, where the vast majority of the traffic came from.

The standard pay-per-click ad on Facebook cost us a dollar or more as we had to compete for every click in a heated auction. But in the model with Facebook Events, website visits only cost a few cents per click.

The traffic didn‚Äôt land at the site immediately, but at a Facebook event. It was better for a number of reasons:

1. It was much easier for the target audience to click Interested or Going in their newsfeed, and that was it. Facebook sent out notifications about each post to every event responder (now selectively).
2. The Facebook newsfeed gave away a lot of viral impressions if people gladly engaged with our events.
3. The established strategy of the traffic exchange‚Äîcross-posting across all our events‚Äîmade it possible to start selling tickets without initial ad investments.
4. The net profit from each ticket sold was re-invested in the advertising of the corresponding event, which further strengthened the organic growth and, as a result, paid marketing and sales.
5. And so it went in a continuous growth cycle.

It was so awesome that I even decided to demonstrate our results to one of the biggest ticketing companies in the world. I showed their marketing department how we could gather an audience on Facebook Events and convert it into tickets ‚Äî we had many more attendees and engagement with similar events than the industry leader. I tried to sell our marketing technology, but it didn‚Äôt work out.

How did the Cambridge Analytica scandal affect Concert With Me?

After the Facebook shock caused by the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg first froze all the API integrations of the platform. Then the company simply cut out all the useful features and updated the algorithms. The changes hit hard on the technologies we had built to promote events.

Facebook also updated the company‚Äôs policies, and after a while, it limited event promotion in our segment. All the above caused a drop in our traffic and pushed our product out of business.

All in all, deep integration with a large platform allowed you to shoot upwards, but the strong dependence became devastating. What did you do next?

This became our rebirth strategy: Keep the best parts of our experience and throw away the worst.

We separated all the marketing best practices from B2C, reassembled them into a B2B product, and went to offer it to former partners, competitors, and friends in the event industry.

This is how [Tendee](https://at.tendee.io/) came into being.

Uncover the history of Tendee.

Tendee is a digital marketing toolbox for events.

Originally we wanted it to be a self-service SaaS, but the product was too complicated for customers. Over time it became a hybrid of SaaS, software integrator, and marketing agency.

The majority of B2B products in the event industry are ticketing systems (stock taking, payment processing). Specialized marketing tools, however, are hard to find, and the level of automation and use of promotion services is lower than, say, in the classic e-commerce. This is where we saw our opportunity.

Personal contact was the main sales channel. We used to start cooperation with our customers as a marketing agency, set up all the systems and integrations, and then gradually teach their teams to use the product on their own to save hundreds of hours of manual effort by automating the event promotion process.

The event market is not so broad. The client‚Äôs onboarding was always manual, and every time they had lots of unique feature requests. This created problems at the level of issue prioritization and the company‚Äôs strategy identification.

What was key to Tendee‚Äôs growth?

For a B2B company in a relatively closed and well-established market, the world revolves around direct sales with ‚Äúcases and logo‚Äù being a matter of life or death.

Cases are about your relationships with the industry‚Äôs well-known companies‚Äîfor whom, in what market segment, and how much you‚Äôve increased the profits. And all the customers have their own boundaries of market segments. As Eugene Lisovsky from Maps.me says: ‚ÄúClients have ‚Äòshelves‚Äô to classify products in their heads. If they don‚Äôt understand which shelf to place your product on, they will simply throw it out of their heads.‚Äù

Since there wasn‚Äôt a shelf for Events Industry Digital Marketing Automation, we chose Facebook Event Promotion Specialists as our category. Pitches with that leitmotif worked well.

Logos are companies you‚Äôve worked with or industry-known people who can refer you. ‚ÄúI know person X,‚Äù ‚ÄúWe were doing a project for company Y.‚Äù Every industry is a small village, so everyone knows each other. But if you‚Äôve wrapped up a few big deals, you ace the Social Proof stage with potential clients.

Obviously, for the offline event industry, networking at offline conventions is the best growth factor. You can meet decision-makers at industry conferences and meetups several times a year. They all know each other well, happy to meet again, and they‚Äôre curious about what new tools they can try for their theater, stadium, or promotion company.

What happened to the event industry after quarantine measures were adopted because of the coronavirus? How did it affect you?

Each and every event was canceled or postponed, and customers began to demand refunds for their tickets.

The vast majority of events are funded with upfront payments than with early bird ticket sales and/or promoter money. The event financial model assumes some small percentage of refunds, but these are tiny numbers. Therefore, mass refunds are fatal for the whole supply chain.

In the US, it is a bit easier as most event tickets are legally non-refundable, and one can only resell them. But in the current situation companies had to make a difficult choice: lose money or lose reputation.

For example, Live Nation declared: ‚ÄúWhere an Event is cancelled, rescheduled, or where there is a material change to the programme of the Event, You will be entitled to a refund.‚Äù And StubHub stated that if an event is canceled, customers can opt to receive a coupon valued at 120% of the original purchase, and this coupon can be applied toward a future event of their choosing.

These decisions have led to a domino effect, with bad things begetting even worse ones‚Äîlayoffs, salary cuts, lawsuits, bankruptcies, and ruin.

Marketing budgets were the first to get slashed. All our current and future projects instantly came to a stop until further notice.

Half of the industry simply hoped to survive the quarantine, and an optimistic mindset I found in only one of a hundred said: ‚ÄúI wanna be prepared for a brighter future, explore automation tools, set up analytics, and look for other interesting solutions while the world is in panic.‚Äù

Everything indicated that we would probably share the fate of companies that won‚Äôt survive the pandemic.

The underestimated path to [product-market fit](https://gopractice.io/blog/what-is-product-market-fit-and-how-to-measure-pmf/), or where organic growth comes fromWhat did you decide to do next?

It was March 16, 2020. I rushed to the States to be closer to the NY cluster of the event industry, so when the quarantine is over, I can resume negotiations ASAP.

While awaiting my flight at the empty airport, I wrote an article about Ducalis, our internal tool for issue prioritization.

The plan was just to drop the article to my Facebook friends, set up a simple landing page with an email capture form and see the reaction. I thought, well, if we get five emails, maybe we could start paying more attention to the product and try to promote it.

Using Google Forms, I hastily assembled a landing page for demo requests as the service wasn‚Äôt accessible beyond our corporate network. On Wednesday, March 18, I published a post on my Medium and Facebook pages, and the next day in the Russian startup community at vc.ru.

Did you manage to get five emails?

The results of the announcement were stunning.

In the first week, we got 160 requests for demos. The feedback from customer interviews was overwhelmingly positive. Product managers and scrum-masters started recommending Ducalis to each other. Even several Agile communities shared the link for free and without us requesting

The team spent tens of hours talking to the first clients from banks, famous startups, one of the largest car manufacturers in the world, and even a product manager from Atlassian itself (the developers of Jira).

One of Atlassian communities reached us out to run a webinar about Ducalis and our story about prioritization struggles. There were 92 attendees.  
In one week, our company moved from a near-death experience to a super active growth phase with a product around a huge pressure point‚Äîissues prioritizations and team synchronization.

How was the experience of launching Ducalis different from your previous products?

Great question, because we will have to compare completely different experiences and markets, but let‚Äôs try to classify together.

***What does it do?***

*Concert With Me:* Ticket eCommerce selling exactly the same secondary tickets as everyone else.

*Tendee:* A combination of methods for promoting events, and the tools that we have developed for these tasks.

*Ducalis:* A service that quickly prioritizes and synchronizes product team goals on Jira.

***Why did it come into being?***

*Concert With Me:* Wanted to create an international eCommerce platform.

*Tendee:* Used the skills, connections and industry promotion tools developed at Concert With Me.

*Ducalis:* Solved the internal problem of issue prioritization.

***The main advantage***

*Concert With Me:* Cheap traffic acquisition from a channel that no one in the industry has ever noticed.

*Tendee:* ‚ÄúAll-in-One‚Äù for digital event marketing.

*Ducalis:* Faster, simpler and more reliable than Jira plug-ins, individual complex services, Google spreadsheets.

***Main reason for growth***

*Concert With Me:* Found a ‚Äúhack‚Äù in Facebook promotion.

*Tendee:* Flying to different parts of the world for meetings, acquaintances, conferences, and subsequent sales.

*Ducalis:* A personal story of solving a problem that has resonated with a lot of people.

***Most popular customer response to product***

*Concert With Me:* ‚ÄúWhy are the tickets so expensive? When will artist X come to town Y?‚Äù

*Tendee:* ‚ÄúWho exactly are you already working with? What are they saying?‚Äù

*Ducalis:* ‚ÄúWe have exactly the same problem with the prioritization of tasks! And how did you solve X?‚Äù

Let‚Äôs take a look at launching on different markets then, shall we?

Generally speaking, the first two products grew mainly because we had built efficient distribution channels:

Concert With Me existed in a very competitive market and its added value was minimal. It was a success because we found a marketing channel that others had missed.

Tendee had great added value for customers, but it solved a problem that the customers were not consciously aware of. Therefore, it required direct sales, and a very long onboarding process through the agency model, where we showed the value of the product in solving the customer‚Äôs immediate needs.

With Ducalis, everything turned upside down.

We found an effective solution to one of our own problems, honestly proved the value to ourselves, and only after that, we shared the product‚Äôs story with other people. This resonated, and organic growth started without any investment in marketing.

Comparing the experience of launching Ducalis to past products allowed you to realize a number of thoughts that you once read in a book by Des Traynor from Intercom, but hadn‚Äôt fully understood at the time. Tell me about it.

Two years ago, I was reading[ Intercom On Marketing](https://www.intercom.com/resources/books/intercom-marketing), a book by Des Traynor and Matt Hodges. Traynor and Hodges began their book by asserting that when you put a product on the market, you have to write stories and tell them to people, an advice that perplexed me at first:

‚ÄúNo matter how good your product is, if you can‚Äôt tell a cohesive, compelling story about it, you‚Äôre going to have a very hard time getting people‚Äôs attention when you actually do take it to market.

‚ÄúFor decades software was sold using feature-based marketing: But SaaS has changed that. A lot of startups spend untold time and resources cooking up some fancy marketing matrix when in fact you just need to have lots of real-life conversations with like-minded people about their problems.‚Äù

I was reading a book about marketing by a founder of a very successful company worth over a billion dollars, and I couldn‚Äôt wrap my head around what he was talking about. So, where are the secrets of Google AdWords? What about email marketing segmentation? Why is there no chapter on Facebook Ads optimization? Which remarketing service should I use? Etc.

But now I realize that due to the specifics of my experience and the markets I had worked in, I previously perceived product promotion in a strict sense of being a process of traffic acquisition, setting up analytics, collecting emails, retargeting, direct sales, and so on.

Finally, with the experience of Ducalis, I grasped the notion about products that start from a real pain. It‚Äôs hard to figure it out in theory ‚Äì one can only experience it. Our team was lucky enough to stumble upon an undiscovered acute problem and find an effective solution for it.

The stories behind [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/about/story), [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/blog/podcasts/intercom-co-founder-des-traynor-on-starting-up/), and [Slack](https://usefyi.com/slack-history/) began the same way. The real challenge triggered the founder‚Äôs sharp pain, not the friend‚Äôs words: ‚ÄúCool stuff! Well, I‚Äôd definitely buy it!‚Äù A sincere honest desire to tackle one‚Äôs own problem was the key to creating high added value, and as a result, to organic growth.

The real-life story of solving one‚Äôs own problem drastically affects product marketing. You have something to tell, and you know the exact pressure points to push. People don‚Äôt click on the ad because it‚Äôs somehow specially set up. They click if an ad message resonates with their personal problems.

They say you‚Äôre not an indication, and you shouldn‚Äôt rely on your needs. To me, that‚Äôs exactly what you should focus on, especially in the early stages of product development. When I worked on games, I noticed that they showed the best results if people in the company were eager to play the games themselves, which also provided vital immediate feedback. Ducalis solved your own problem, too. Tell me how you came up with the product.

At some point in our work on Tendee, our Jira backlog was overgrown with an endless list of ideas that anyone could record there.

Everyone in the team saw the truth in their own way, so the tasks were undertaken randomly. We broke everything from your advice: ‚ÄúWhy saying ‚Äòno‚Äô is important for product development‚Äù.

We decided to rethink the issue prioritization in the company. After reviewing some of the systems, we settled on a hybrid of [RICE](https://www.intercom.com/blog/rice-simple-prioritization-for-product-managers/) and [AARRR](https://medium.com/@ms.mbalke/aarrr-framework-metrics-that-let-your-startup-sound-like-a-pirate-ship-e91d4082994b), with different weights for each criterion (below in parentheses).

A product manager had to evaluate issues by the following criteria:

* Sales. Helps with Sales. (1)
* Activation. Shows the benefits of the product. (1)
* Retention. Returns users to the product. (1)
* Service. Reduces customer support costs. (1)
* Fb Ads. Gets us closer to being a Facebook Marketing Partner. (1)
* Mass. How many customers, events or money it affects. (1)

A developer had to evaluate issues by the following criteria:

* Time. Time spent on development / Complexity. (-3)
* Value. Importance for development and product. (2)

You immediately developed your own service to automate this task?

No. We quickly connected Google Sheets, Automate.io, and Jira Cloud to automate this workflow, but this Frankenstein only worked for a couple of months. And then everything fell apart.

The main problems and pains were as follows:

* Google Sheets was overgrown with old tasks.
* There were lots of duplicates due to synchronization errors.
* We had to open a gazillion tabs to read each issue description and understand the context.
* Coworkers evaluated issues on different weekdays. Sometimes someone just forgot to evaluate them. It became too difficult to coordinate top priorities.
* It was impossible to update the spreadsheet (add/remove criteria or teammate).
* It didn‚Äôt allow us to reevaluate old issues. Some scores became outdated as our team‚Äôs priorities evolved.

We did want to solve the problem of issue prioritization, and even rigged a solution and integrated it into our processes, but it didn‚Äôt work for technical reasons.

So then, understanding all the details of the process, you decided to make an internal tool to ease the pain?

Yes, our developers offered to design our own internal solution. They made it in their spare time as a residual, and the first version appeared after a couple of months. We were sure that it would be an internal soft just for us and chose a gag name Ducalis because of the memes.

Since we devoted all the time to our main product, Ducalis only had the important features we could best use in our workflow. Eventually, there was nothing extra in the tool due to this ascetic approach.

We evaluated ideas for the development of Ducalis using the tool itself. We chose the criteria based on our prioritization experience with Google Sheets. Thus there were: UI speed, context availability, frequency of use, collaboration, development time. We made the product for ourselves, so we got a blazing fast UI, handy reminders in Slack, full issue context at our fingertips, and all the necessary hints about criteria. It tackled our problem brilliantly.

How exactly did you know that the product was solving the problem?

The team was actively using Ducalis for weekly assessments, and this had notable benefits in combating the prioritization problem:

* It started to take 15 minutes a week to assign scores. The system worked like a clock, and everyone was trained to evaluate their issues weekly.
* The Friday ritual of issues reading by all team members was born. We had a much better understanding of the general scopes of tasks and [groomed the backlog](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/backlog-grooming/) every week. Google Sheets could not sync us unless we manually pinged each other.
* Scores were discarded monthly, and outdated issues were to be assessed again. Often we would simply delete them. Expiring scores cured the problem of ‚Äúsoul searching,‚Äù which again was impossible in Google Spreadsheets.
* This process generated many ‚Äúproductive conflicts.‚Äù People started asking questions like ‚ÄúWhat kind of task is that?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy would you do that?‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand the description,‚Äù ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt seem to matter.‚Äù They provided feedback and respectfully disagreed with each other, which led to better priority negotiations.
* The team also began to discuss the criteria themselves, thinking about how one or another part of the system affects the success of the entire product and company.
* Product managers and salespeople began to understand the importance of code refactoring issues, and developers realized why the make-up of the helpdesk is so important.
* It even became a small game. Ducalis regularly awarded progress by posting who had ‚Äúnailed it‚Äù on the Slack channel. Public appreciation from the heartless machine also worked great. That‚Äôs why the teammates tried to evaluate the issues on time, and got upset when they couldn‚Äôt.

That is, Ducalis has changed your prioritization process and made your team more efficient. At that point, did you realize that you‚Äôd created something valuable?

We had no go-to-market plans for Ducalis. All we wanted to do was clean up our planning and prioritization chaos.

It never occurred to us that this product could be useful to other teams outside our organization.

There were so many hotshot articles, advice, and conference talks about the right product strategies, prioritization approaches, and roadmap formations that it seemed we were the last company that was tackling the issue prioritization problem.

When the event industry slipped into a coma because of the coronavirus, the first reflex was ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs turn the product towards online events.‚Äù

However, it implied a completely different marketing strategy, and Tendee wasn‚Äôt ready for it.

At the same time, I was reading the news about the increase of Zoom users and was envious of the services that are fully online. As silly as that sounds, I thought, ‚ÄúWhat if I serve Ducalis as a tool for remote teams?‚Äù

And I was surprised myself that we didn‚Äôt have to ‚Äúinvent‚Äù anything. We‚Äôve been a remote team for several years, and with the help of Ducalis, we‚Äôve learned how to synchronize different points of view on features and priorities in product development.

I didn‚Äôt even tell any of my colleagues about the plan. I just decided to write an article and see if we get at least five emails from the submission form. And you already know how it went from there.

When the product targets a specific problem so precisely, a huge number of feature requests and ideas come in (feature creep), and dark forces begin to pull the project in all directions. How do you deal with it? What are your key criteria for the development of Ducalis now?

Having finally understood Des Traynor‚Äôs covenants, we now have two main tasks:

* Listen to as many stories, problems, and pain points about prioritization as possible. Don‚Äôt try to persuade anybody to use our product, but turn on active listening and empathy to understand the customers‚Äô processes, pain points, and solutions.
* Find the segment with the best match between our solution and their pain. Decide what we can do better for them, and understand how much they are willing to pay for it.

So far, based on the results of the first few dozens of in-depth interviews, it has become clear that the needs of the corporate segment should be studied in more detail. To close deals with large customers the product must be further developed towards security, access control, encryption, and work in corporate networks.

At the same time, we continue to focus on factors that we‚Äôve identified based on our experience with spreadsheets. We have also already validated that they all resonate well with our clients:

* Speed: The issue evaluation process is extremely slow when each issue is opened in a separate tab. We want to spend as little time as possible on the issue evaluation process.
* Retention: That‚Äôs really important to make teas evaluate issues consistently, and notifications are essential here. For nor, we send notifications to Slack solely, but we are thinking of other messengers, too.
* Collaboration: The key task of the tool is to give an overall picture to the whole team, to synchronize the vision, to start crucial discussions at the right moment (before development).
* Self-Service: Make the UI intuitive, write help articles, suggest how and what is better to configure, which criteria to choose.

All this has been transformed into our criteria for issues prioritization in Ducalis for the further development of the product.

And one last question. How would you summarize your key takeaways from the story so far‚Äîand clearly, it is still in its beginning?

As usual, it‚Äôs more sophisticated than ‚Äúone main idea.‚Äù

**Mega-platforms are not your friends‚Äîbut neither are they your enemies.** We live in the age of mega-platforms that have monopolized certain market segments: search, communication, social networking, video, etc. It is almost impossible not to depend on them, but it is fundamental to be able to diversify the risk. Design your product to integrate with platforms while considering that it may no longer exist at some point in time. Bad strategy: Concert With Me‚Äôs full dependency on Facebook. Good strategy: Zapier diverse strategy.

**Focus on the added value of the product, on how you solve people‚Äôs problems, not on bugs, features, and other attributes.** Tendee‚Äôs customers complained about every little bug, and several times it was why they stopped using our product (a post wasn‚Äôt published, metrics weren‚Äôt updated). On Ducalis calls, clients asked me a couple of times to stop apologizing for tiny bugs. They say they understand everything and believe we will fix it. Every tool has bugs, but if the product truly treats the pain, it won‚Äôt be the reason they‚Äôre leaving.

**Don‚Äôt take feedback at face value.** **Develop empathy and try to understand the issues and real motivation of your customers.** Listen actively and develop empathy. Don‚Äôt promise the moon. Don‚Äôt try to persuade someone they are wrong. Think about the reasons why they ask for something, try to understand what problems they want to solve (and things they don‚Äôt want to touch). Listen to as many stories as possible. The team and I have recorded dozens of calls, and we listen to them again every now and then to collect stories and problems.

**An honest story of solving the real problem is better than a list of cool features.** Every single customer has said that this or that idea from the announcement-blogspot resonated deep. Nobody said: ‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs a nice feature.‚Äù Our real and detailed history of solving the problem replaced the feedback of the first clients (that didn‚Äôt exist) and became our best landing page, salesman, and marketer.",startups,1587634750,unab0mber,1,1,True,2020-04-23

172,How do pre-PMF consumer tech start ups usually spend their first 150k?,"**Context**: I've worked on this app(consumer software) with a friend for almost a year. We launched this Jan/feb and got decent traffic from Reddit HN PH and random medias.(\~10k signups since) But I'd say still got quite a long way from PMF.

**Our background**: engineering students, never interned at a consumer tech start ups.

**Question background:** So earlier this year, we applied for YC with the mentality of ""why not"" and to our surprise we got an interview. We're preparing for the interview at the moment, and is kinda struck by the question ""how will you spend the 150k""

To be honest, raising money wasn't a part of our roadmap. We planned to raise money only once we hit PMF, and then use that money for scaling + marketing. We don't think we *need* to raise money right now since we can build everything we need ourselves. We have the mentality of: ""why hire someone else do it when we can do it""

But then a part of me think that **I simply don't know what I don't know**. Looking at all these other start ups that raise pre-seed makes me think if I'm missing out. What *if* I can pay a pro design firm 20k and they will be able to design a perfect version of our app for us. I mean, they're pros for a reason right? Drastically decreasing the time it takes for us to reach PMF. Then in that case I'd be going around begging for money to accelerate our growth.

Most of the articles on the internet about landing pages have 60 point checklists. 60, serious? These lists suppose to help you but they can only create more confusion and anxiety.

So I created my own list. It contains only major conversion points and triggers. And eventually, I ended up with a 14 point checklist. Believe me, you don't need to overcomplicate things to increase your conversions.

So here I go,

(I'll try to make it short and sweet but also share extra articles and resources at the end of the post)

# #1 Clear Value Proposition

A clear value proposition is a short and compelling summary of the primary benefit that you offer to your prospects.

The attention span of a typical visitor is lower than a goldfish. So you should start talking about your visitor‚Äôs pain point and your offer in the very first phrase.

Your value proposition needs to answer these 2 questions within 5 seconds.

1. Which product or service does this website offer?¬†
2. What is unique about this product or service?

Here are three things to outline before you write your value proposition.

* **Know your ideal customer.**

Her language, struggles and major pain points that make her upset.

* **Specific and concrete benefits of your product**

.Focus on one primary benefit and include qualitative or quantitative, measurable end results of your product.

* **Unique Strength**

What differentiates you from your competitors? Use your unique strength to convince your visitors.

[https://imgur.com/a/1Alw6Ey](https://imgur.com/a/1Alw6Ey) \- This canvas makes it easy.

# #2 Visual Focus

The background image of the first visual your visitors see. It‚Äôs a precious element, it would be a shame to waste it with a static image.

You can match your this visual with the value proposition to empower your message and grab your visitor‚Äôs attention.¬†

Here are some ideas:

* If it‚Äôs a personal brand -&gt; Show your face.
* If it‚Äôs a product -&gt; Show your product with a happy customer, or show the ease of use or show the interface.
* If it‚Äôs a service -&gt; Show happy customers, share a moment from the environment.

Think of how you can get through the feeling or end result of your product to your visitors.

# #3 Short forms

Make your forms short and sweet for higher conversion rates. Ask for an email and that‚Äôs it, you have everything to start a conversation.

Long forms are scary, and in general, they have lower conversion rates. Try not to ask people their company, city, dog‚Äôs name and how many cousins they have, as long as it‚Äôs not a must.

# #4 Call to actions

Right after you talk about their pain points and present your offer, call your visitors for action. Their attention span is short, so you should show the next step before they leave the page.

Blend your value proposition and call to action to make it more effective.

Avoid: ‚ÄúClick here‚Äù or ‚ÄúContact us.‚Äù

Instead, use: ‚ÄúStart building a landing page‚Äù. Or make it more attractive and write ‚ÄúBuild a high-converting landing page now‚Äù.

Have a single focus call to action. If your product is too complicated, then you can have a secondary CTA, such as ‚ÄúLearn more about x.‚Äù

The design of your CTA is also critical. Try to find attractive colors that complement each other and make sure these colors are matching with your brand identity.

# #5 Social Proof

People don‚Äôt know you. And the social proof is a shortcut to building an instant trust.

There are tens of social proof strategies, here are some of the most effective ones:

* Show how many people purchased your product ‚Äì 3043 people bought this course.
* Written testimonials from your customers
* Video Testimonials. A happy customer could sale better than your best salesperson
* Badges. Such as security or trust badges.
* Logos. Show the brands you have worked with.

# #6 1:1 attention ratio

You know attention is the only currency you have. And you need to guide that attention to your offer, only, lonely. So you should get rid of all clickables, navigation elements, search bar and the rest of distractors.

Keep the attention laser-focused to your holy goal: conversion.

# #7 Make it personalized

Browse subreddits, Quora and specific forums to find out how your target audience speaks and writes. Then try to talk their language on your landing page.¬†

For example: If your potential customers are millennials, you can use ‚Äúgimme‚Äù instead of ‚Äúgive me‚Äù to make them feel like they‚Äôre talking with a friend.

They‚Äôll easily choose a friend over your competitors.

Note: Never use complicated words when there is a simple alternative. Try to keep your copy at the elementary level, it‚Äôs easier for the brain to understand even when it‚Äôs educated.

# #8¬†Help your visitors by showing all the steps

You think your product is too straightforward and doesn‚Äôt need further explanation? Don‚Äôt leave a space for assumptions. Show how people can use, configure or implement your product.

Even the most straightforward product needs a step by step explanation. Because these steps give your visitors a sense of security.

This step by step approach will give your visitors a gameplan after they purchase your product. You‚Äôre placing stepping stones to help them cross the river of doubt. Use five or six steps at max. Otherwise, you may accidentally over complicate your product instead of helping them.

# #9 Use bullet points to present your features or benefits.

I‚Äôll make this one a live example for you.

**Example 1.**

With landing page software X, you can easily design your landing page by using templates and drag-and-drop features, so no coding skill needed. Also, you can A/B test and connect your landing pages to your favorite marketing tools to get the best out of it. If you have any problems, our customer‚Äôs support is on the line to help you, 7/24.

Ok, I confess I wrote it with no love to make it look worst.

**Example 2**

With X:

* No coding skills required.
* Design easily with a drag-and-drop feature.
* Use 100+ templates
* A/B test to find out what works best for you.
* Connect X with your favorite marketing tools.
* 7/24 fast online support.

You see, the first one is crowded and boring.

The second one is effortlessly flowing and snackable.

You know what is even better than that?¬†Transforming the features to benefits.¬†

To do this, you can sort all of your features and try to squeeze emotional benefits from each.

**For example:**

* No coding skills required ‚Äì You‚Äôll never be dependent on an IT guy who rarely keeps his deadlines.
* Use 100+ templates ‚Äì With templates, you‚Äôll save hours and instead, you can spend your time doing your favorite things.

Always use bullet points instead of long sentences to make your points concise and attractive.

# #10 Page speed optimization

Is your landing page loads slower than 3 sec? WTF, are you living in a cave or smt?

Yes, people are annoyed if your page loads slower than 3 sec and then they bounce. And you‚Äôll never see each other again.

The speed of your landing page is a passive component but it‚Äôs super important for two reasons.¬†

**One:** as I mentioned, you lost your precious visitors.

**Two:** It also gives you the upper hand to rank higher on Google search.

There are many ways to find out your page speed, Google's speed test is my go-to.

After you took the test, follow the suggestions of Google to make your page faster

# #11 Clear communication (what, why, how)

Make sure that your visitor immediately knows what he can get (WHAT), how he can get it (HOW) and why he needs it (WHY).¬†

You can map out the structure of your landing page with these three communications pillars. The order can be flexible for each product, but in general, it‚Äôs like that:

**Why?**¬†You‚Äôre embarrassed because you have a sweating problem.

**What?**¬†Sweatnot can help you to get rid of your sweaty palms.

**How?**¬†You can buy it by clicking the CTA and start using it in three easy steps.¬†

I know what you‚Äôre thinking and no, I don‚Äôt have a sweating problem.

# #12 Mobile Friendly ‚Äì Responsive

If there were a constitution of the landing pages, that would be one of the major laws. Seriously, triple check your landing page and optimize it for your mobile visitors.¬†

# #13 Create urgency

Scarcity increases the conversion rates but it needs to seem natural and rational. It‚Äôs a robust psychological trigger called[¬†loss aversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion)¬†and also known as FOMO.

These days, almost everything is limited edition and available for a limited time, so don't try to make a monkey out of your visitors. Use it carefully.

\#14 Repeating the call-to-action

Hey, do you remember me? It‚Äôs me again, call to action and I‚Äôm here to transform you to into a customer.

No jokes here,¬†Don‚Äôt hesitate to repeat your CTA 2 to 3 times more on your landing page. Your visitors could get distracted and drift away without clicking your call to action.

So add some more action.

So what does your landing page looks like?

Here is a scheme I use. You don't strictly have to hold on to the order.

**Header**

* Value proposition
* Matching visual
* Tagline
* Form
* Call to action
* **Section 1**
* Description + video if possible
* **Section 2**
* How to use the service or products
* **Section 3**
* Social proof
* **Section 4**
* Call to action -&gt; link to the header.

197,Incorporate Google Business Listing To Your Startup,"In a world where exchanges are digitalizing at a phenomenal speed, the ability of a structure or brand to offer a better user experience will allow it to stand out from the competition.

All tools should be used for this purpose.

In the case of [Google listing](https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/business/), the support gives access to various possibilities.

Google allows you to create and manage business listing that will then be available on various Google products on the web and mobile. 

Optimizing Google listing to a site is quite similar to that of a standard web page.

Thus it is vital to ensure that its content is relevant.

For this, all useful information (contact details, address, route, opening hours, and others) on the brand or the company must be completed. 

**Advantage of a Good Listing**

* Free service
* Help people find you
* Visibility on Google services
* Promotes local referencing

**Prerequisites**

1. Your company must have a physical address (postal address)
2. Once your file has been validated, you can try to add a territory served if you wish
3. You must have a Google account

**So, how do you create a Google Listing?**

The process is very simple! 

1. **Go to Google and sign in to your Google Account**
2. **Find your Establishment:** Accept the terms of use and enter the name or telephone number of your company to locate your establishment.  Even if you‚Äôve never registered it, there is probably a listing for your business. The information found there comes from various directories such as the Yellow Pages. Click on the name of your establishment for the suggested list.  If no file is available for your company, you can now create one.
3. **Validate the Ownership of your File:** Google must verify that you are now the owner of the business before granting you the right to edit the listing.  Preferably, choose validation by phone. You shall receive an automated call instantly. 
4. **Your business is verified for your Google Account:** You are now the owner of your business listing. Nobody can modify this file without your authorization. 
5. **Optimize your Business Listing:** Once your card has been validated, you can now improve it.  You can also seek the opinions of your customers, create campaigns to buy keywords, and consult the statistics of your file.  Your file allows you to indicate:

* The name of your establishment
* Your address
* Your contact details
* The category or categories of your establishment
* Your opening hours
* Pictures
* A description

Now,  your Google Listing is now visible on Google :)

Internet users are carrying out more and more localized searches.

Creating a Google listing for your business allows you to increase your visibility, respond to reviews, and stay informed.

200,Pulling ahead of the competition?,"
The general way to beat the competition from what peter thiel from the book zero to one says is to create a product that's 10x better in some way. 

Aim to make your offer better by   5x - 10x  than the competition by some way. So if it's a computer mouse, you might find a spot in the market where you can create a mouse that's minimalist design, and uses only recyclable wood. It's better on the aspect that the brand, and product has this vintage, natural style. A product that is 5x - 10x better in being a lifestyle brand for more fitness, natural lifestyle market. **This is generally how you pull ahead of the competition, like the mouse example you spend your money efficiently to create something that is unique which allows you to pull ahead of the competition and keep pulling ahead**. So eventually you will be able to win over that piece of the market.

I realised that the best process would be similar to how you would do A/B and beta testing, however you can't really go live with three different logos, so you need to just present the logos and get anonymous unbiased responses so you can make an informed decision.

There were a few options I found:

- UsabilityHub: This website allows you to do A/B testing, by simply placing two or three pictures side by side and asking potential users to rate which they prefer.  This is a little pricey for startups, but a fairly robust option for further down the track.

-Reddit Polls: You could create a poll on r/polls and then put a link to a website with the three logo designs. This way you could do such testing without needing to fork out any money. You aren't however guaranteed to get enough responses to be meaningful.

-Test Your Ideas: This is a website where you can upload your logo pictures and get guaranteed quantitative feedback about which is the best. This is also free to run, however at this stage you cannot target to a specific group.

My partner and I are both strong tech cofounders. For about 2 years we have been providing services to enterprises in blockchain space with focus on supply chain. Our traction isn't great but enough to sustain very frugal life style. Two promising projects vanished cause of Covid 19 :(

&amp;#x200B;

A investor reached out to us on Linkedin, located in the same city as us. He has been in marketing (social media, some CRM work, ad campaigns) services for 7 years and sold it to Denstu for about $30m USD (his share is \~$10m - we pulled his records from public data). He wants to invest about 500-700k USD in some deep tech startups and is looking at ""upwards of 30%"" in his words. He is evaluating us and 2 other companies considerably larger than us.

&amp;#x200B;

His plan: 

1) Setup a back office for AI, ML and blockchain services led by a small and young team proficient enough to lead them. Invest enough to become profitable by 2nd year

2) Handle the initial sales and marketing till he setups up sales team in USA and EU

3) Budget for marketing guys will come from his company and will take a cut from all sales, while all dev related payroll from ours - not sure how this will work out and affect our burn rate

4) Future funding if required will come from him - might lead to insane equity dilution and unfavorable share holder agreements, specially if the marketing costs are not properly accounted for

5) He prefers sticking to services but ""can"" be open to products if we can show enough traction

6) Project ticket sizes will be $30-60k USD as per his estimates - trying to understand how large we can really be

We will be discussing if we can do a project as independent company to see how we work together and to see what kind of work he can get. Question is how much equity, and what should I be careful of. Can someone experienced please give me some advice

225,The Remote Work Experiment,"Here's a recent article I wrote on remote work. It's my first shot in putting my thoughts out there. Would love some feedback on what I could improve on :)

\---

In the recent past, the allure of remote work has tickled the fancy of almost all modern, web workers. Quite possibly, the only real criteria for remote work is a working internet connection and a laptop with good battery life. Organisations like GitLab, Automattic and Zapier have shown that fully remote companies can be wildly successful. Almost all of these companies have written extensively on the benefits of remote work. The founders of Basecamp - a project management tool - even decided to write entire books on it! The trend towards remote work had been catching on at a steady pace but recently, things have changed rather swiftly.¬†

The global pandemic COVID-19 has forced organisations to make the shift to remote work *overnight*. And this shift has had a major influence across the entire web ecosystem. Remote tools like Zoom and Slack have seen generous spikes in user growth. Thousands of blog posts on remote work have been flushed into the interweb. Every web worker has a new dedicated space in their house called ‚Äòoffice‚Äô. The web is truly *remote* now.

Even with the world turning desolate due to this pandemic, executives in these organisations are secretly hopeful that they could get to taste the proclaimed benefits of remote work.

A few weeks after going remote, organisations will start to notice that their employees are showing significant boosts in productivity. Developers start writing a lot more lines of code, content writers take a day instead of two for their blog posts, designers have their wireframes ready sooner and sales make more demo calls in the day. Everybody, and especially the people on top, are loving this new found trove of productivity in the organisation.

It‚Äôs easy to ride this new wave of productivity but alas, all waves do crash. Will organisations be prepared to sustain this momentum indefinitely? To answer this question, organisations will first need to ask themselves - what was hindering their employees from being productive before going remote? If you look at the differences on paper, only the employee‚Äôs location has changed from the office to the living room (or bedroom). So, what really has brought in this rise of productivity? It cannot just be a location thing.

The answer is simple. It‚Äôs more focused work. Employees have more time for deep, concentrated work and this results in better work done faster; which in essence, means better productivity. Remote work has also forced employees to communicate better and more often leading to better collaboration within the teams.

This new global batch of remote organisations need to look at this forced experiment with remote work as an opportunity to uncover gaps that lead to reduced productivity in the physical office space. The executive team in these organisations need to use this period to investigate why focus and communication was a blocker for employees before and how to provide for an environment that can unblock these hurdles when they come back to office later this year.

The hope is that when the dust settles and everyone can resume work in a physical office, the organisation and its employees would have had a taste of how powerful great focus and communication can turn out to be. The hope is that employees will now have a new instilled sense of confidence and accountability. That they are more aware of their time and what to do with it. That their managers would have realised the importance of keeping their teams in constant sync. And that the executive team will realise why it‚Äôs critical to keep sharing the vision and mission with others. And for me, selfishly, I hope that everyone will realise that some meetings could have just been emails and most emails could have just been messages on Slack.

There is scope for some of these organisations to completely adopt remote work when things get back to normal as they might have a product and culture that supports it. However, there are some organisations that cannot adopt it for whatever reason and that‚Äôs alright; not every organisation needs to be remote. But, it is my sincere belief that every organisation can learn a lot about productivity from remote work. I implore the executives, managers and employees from these organisations to take a step back and see what they can take away from this forced experiment.

This global pandemic has a lot to teach us. But are we ready to learn?",startups,1587729394,shoaib-gs,1,1,True,2020-04-24

I‚Äôm really bullish on membership sites, paid newsletters, and private podcasts. Why?

Media is commoditized. Everyone and their mom has a blog. Same with podcasts now. There are free-to-join online communities for every niche.

So the differentiators become (1) exclusivity, (2) curation, and (3) niching down.

People are longing to cut out the noise.

Things are growing so quickly I sometimes feel like I'm playing catch up. The other two founders, my friends, they seem to be managing really well. Looking at the personal growth they've achieved in the past year is astounding. I'm so proud of them, but at the same time, I feel like I'm not growing at the same speed as them.

It's bothering me and it makes me feel like I'm not lifting my own weight. I have 5 people I supervise and I feel like I'm faking 90% of my supervising.. They seem to have this expectation that I can solve all of their problems that they bring up, and most of the time I'm just pulling solutions out of thin air and it sets them back on their way. I guess that works, but it seems completely fake.

262,Chicken vs. Egg for social networks?,"When trying to launch an app how do you go about this? You need users to attract businesses, but you need businesses to attract users. Getting businesses to sign up and advertise (even for free) is hard because there is no user base and no metrics? But you can't attract users unless you have businesses advertising on your platform? 

It is a weird situation and one I couldn't figure out. I spent years spinning my wheels and going nowhere with app development (even lost $2500 to Indian freelancers). I found a franchise owner of Firehouse Subs who was willing to partner 3 stores but I couldn't get the app finished due to lack of money or knowing how to code on my own. I placed top 5 in a city business competition and had 2,200 Instagram followers but I gave up and took a step back because what I was doing just wasn't working beyond having a ""good idea"" I could NEVER actually get an app developed. *Nowadays, I'm focusing on learning more technology by doing tech support, learning networking/security, and then moving into programming next year so I can finish my app on my own. This way will allow me to make more money to fund my company and generally be given more ""respect"" in the tech industry which will attract valuable team members and tech investors hopefully. Basically, walking the walk of being a tech expert and knowing tech very well versus being some random person who just has a good idea.* (**Stupid or smart idea?**)

1. Is owning a tech startup seems to be all about who you know and how much money you have? (Connections will lead to others giving you help/management team and recognition, meanwhile money allows you to produce and improve your product, hire experts to help, attract other businesses, and advertise.) 

Basically, is the idea of starting an app company for the average Joe with no money almost impossible? We hear stories of success but behind the stories you often find out these founders usually went to Ivy league schools, came from wealthy/prominent families, got a head start learning valuable skills like coding, or miraculously came into contact with successful people somewhere along the way. Is the idea of ""Think and Grow Rich"" all a farce for 99% of aspiring tech entrepreneurs? Starting a small pizza shop for an amateur chef is relatively much easier than starting a tech company that needs large amounts of money to become profitable...it seems almost impossible for the average tech enthusiast.",startups,1587793740,Professional-Dork26,49,1,True,2020-04-24

271,Caby: A ride hailing company designed for the African Market," 

[Caby](https://cabycabs.com/) was built for the African, and in specific Kenyan market at heart. Many ride hailing companies have come to Kenya, but the problem is they do not change anything on their model to suit the Kenyan market. Instead, they push with what they have. This often results in many conflicts and strikes from the drivers. The complaint is usually one, The Ride hailing companies are taking too much money from them. As a result, we created a new model, a different model, the daily fixed model. With this the drivers don't pay any commission per ride instead they pay a one time off fee and use the app with no additional charge for the next 24 hours.

You may ask yourself, why not ask for a monthly fee instead. And this is because we understand the Kenyan market. The economy is hand to mouth not many drivers would afford this. So the daily fix works best. But the drivers can still switch to a commission system if they do not like the daily fix. We hand the power back to them.

This also means we can make the fare a little cheaper without hurting the drivers' earnings.

Let's do this practical. A trip costs $10 dollars with many ride hailing companies they would take at least 10% of the trip meaning if the driver takes five trips worth $10 the ride hailing company would take $5. With Caby's daily fix, the driver may pay $2 as the standard fee. What this means even if they take 10 trips worth $10 each we will still take $2. This is why I talked about making trips cheaper without hurting the driver. At the end of the day they still make more money with us, even if the client pays less. This is a business model sculptured for the Kenyan market.

Other features that make Caby specific to the Kenyan market are

1. In app payment with Mpesa: A big problem we have had is that drivers often inflate the cab fare by taking screenshots and showing that to you instead of the actual amount. With [Mpesa](https://www.safaricom.co.ke/personal/m-pesa) the biggest money transfer option in East africa, you receive a pop up even if your internet is off ensuring that you pay the exact fair.
2. the ride will not start unless you are in the vehicle. This is another problem that is big in Kenya, where the driver may start a trip before you get into the vehicle, leading to you paying more for a trip.",startups,1587806902,alvyin11,1,1,True,2020-04-25

308,Choosing a Shipping Software/Platform for Hardware Startup,"Greetings hive mind,

I run a small hardware company in Canada which involves a lot of shipping. We mostly use UPS and Canada Post at around $10K spend per month and have been using Shippo to manage shipments and tracking. 

Since the time we are spending keeps going up, I wanted to look for a new shipping system that would better integrate with our ecommerce platform (Woocommerce) and provide some new features.  Shippo is great as it provides all of the rates automatically to compare and is a fairly simple software all in all, but lacks a lot of features that I think would be useful.

I have tried Shipstation which I like but has some small issues that need to get fixed to make it a good contender. The biggest one being that it does not support multi-currency (which is especially a big deal on customs forms)

ShippingEasy unfortunately only works for US companies...

I was hoping to get some other recommendations for shipping systems. Here are the features I am looking for:

\- Integration with Woocommerce

\- Ability to pull up orders by barcode/print labels (Shipstation has this feature)

\- Multi-currency

\- Good automation features (ability to print documents automatically, choose shipping options based on data, etc)

Does anyone have any recommendations for other shipping software? Thanks!",startups,1587859134,themostsavageandy,0,1,True,2020-04-25

We have launched our startup and seeing some activity and clues for revenue. We are planning to hit certain metrics before raising, and need help understanding how to calculate the runaway. 

It‚Äôs harder to raise now and thus if we do, we most likely would need 18-24months of runaway. Which would (hopefully) allows to stay afloat in post COVID, iterating few times and get closer to PMF and/or profitability mark. 

We don‚Äôt plan to grow a lot of the period but apart from me and my cofounder we will need to make few hires (1 design, 1-2 dev, 1 ops or marketing). Assume everyone is remote and paid 5k/m.

Also our startup is around video streaming, so server costs are going to be big deal, however we have no fixed number of what it will be. the video streams are paid, so we will recover some expenses, not necessarily all until we nail the business/financial models. 

Marketing will be up to 10% of our expenses.

385,Do we need to improve on Excel/Google Sheets?,"Hello folks!   


I'm not sure about other places, but in my country huge amount of small/medium businesses run on Excel or Google Sheets. They do almost everything with it: from managing todos to calculating salaries. I don't say that this is bad (let me know if you think otherwise, it'll help a lot!) but the problem is that many business owners do not understand or do not want to bother with excel. Sometimes they just want to see some numbers or simple reports.  


I wonder: would someone be interested in a tool (or tools) that will be based on Excel data but provide better interface and user experience?  
Consider following example. You have a google sheet displaying how much your shop does money everyday and probably some little calculation for average item price. It is filled by a desk person.  
How handy it would be for you as a business owner to have a mobile app that allows you to view your data from that google sheet from your mobile phone?  
Do we have a room for improvement in that space?  


P.S. I'll appreciate any thoughts in regard excel and how good or bad its for you, thanks",startups,1587968480,fminutes,11,1,True,2020-04-26

390,Bira 91 Raises $20 Million,"Bira 91, the Indian beer brand, has raised $20 million as part of a bridge round led by existing investors Sequoia India and¬†Belgium's Sofina Capital. Consumer-focused Sixth Sense Ventures, Korean private equity firm¬†Neoplux and some family offices also participated in the round.

This round of investment comes at a time when the sale of liquor ‚Äì¬†deemed non-essential by the Indian Home Ministry¬†‚Äì has stopped almost completely as the Coronavirus outbreak has forced governments to enforce lockdowns and people to stay home.

&gt;Jain told [Entrepreneur India](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349817)¬†that it was ""a message of strength"" and the company had plans in place for business to resume as soon as things get better on the outside.

""The lockdown is expected to be lifted over the next few weeks. We‚Äôve mapped our business restart plan specific to every brewery and district, including social distancing norms and compliance of guidelines issued by the government for COVID-19,"" he said.

Last year, the company commissioned two new breweries, one each in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, and quadrupled its production capacity. With the launch of its¬†new product Boom in several markets, it also doubled its national market share in fiscal 2020 to a little less than 3 per cent¬†of the overall¬†market.

Bira 91 also expanded its presence to more than 400 cities in the last fiscal year, up from 50 from a year earlier.

&gt;""Our market shares in several markets are now higher than 5 per cent of overall beer, and more than [20 per cent¬†share of premium beer](https://www.selectyourdeals.com/bira-91-raises-20-million-bridge-fund/),"" Jain said in a statement, adding that 2020 is a key inflection point for the company where they¬†expect to reach double digit market share¬†in a number of states.",startups,1587974606,Abhitech992,1,1,True,2020-04-27

406,Market Size Estimate Doubts,"Not sure if this is the right subreddit for this question.

I'm working on estimating the market size for our startup and have run into some doubts. We are based in the UK, and one theory we'd like to test is to target mid-size UK companies in the financial services, health and tech sectors.

* I have found a reliable source for the average annual spend in our category by size. (i.e. a company with 250-499 employees spends ¬£900k annually on average on x).
* I have the total number of mid-size companies in the UK. And I have a sector breakdown (i.e. the Information and Communication sector represents 8.3% of total UK businesses).

My plan is: # of midsize companies \* % in our target sectors \* average annual spend

The problem is that the sector breakdown is for total UK companies, and not broken down by company size.

I was wondering, for the sake of estimating, if it's accurate enough to apply the total sector percentages on mid-size companies even though it wouldn't be 100% accurate. What do you all think?

a) Ask for the credit card information **before the free trial starts** in order to facilitate conversion from the trial to active, paying user. But probably keep some users from even trying the service, as they don't want to put down their credit card info for something they don't know at all.

b) Let them use the free trial just with registering by e-mail and ask for the credit card information **only after the trial ends** and they want to continue using the service. Reducing the barrier to try it out, but probably having a much harder time converting the test user into an active, paying user.

I was wondering, if anyone of you has experience they want to share, if you are using either one of those options and what feedback you get from your users? Maybe even some numbers on conversion rates? Have you ever switched from one version to the other and what was the result of the switch?

My concrete question is ... can I estimate a value (only as a reference) in order to calculate vesting? and how can I go about this (if at all) with no traction, only a well-tested idea on paper?

440,Digital Products Startup - Giving Co-Founder Profit Share vs Equity,"I will be launching an online digital products start up later this year. Once launched the company can start generating revenue fairly quickly as there is minimal overhead (as with most digital products) and we have a highly scaleable marketing strategy (mostly online ads). 

Recently I approached one of my mentors (a high profile figure within our niche industry) to propose we collaborate on the companies initial product offer (utilizing his likeness &amp; image) and split all net profits 50/50. He was not only onboard with the idea, but he also expressed further interest in being apart in growing the company as a whole. 

He wants to form a partnership in which he strategically helps the company grow as an advisor and also setting up meetings with other high profile figures (his network is wide with access to many notable figures IE celebrities he has worked with before) and potential investors, while I take care of the day to day operations and overall company direction. 

In addition, he has access to contribute some resources (equipment, workspace, some initial \[small\] capital, etc) to help the company create our first initial products. 

He just asked me to send him a document outlining potential terms for our partnership in the business. Besides the 50/50 split of net profits from his self-branded digital product, we did not discuss specific numbers or titles as to what our partnership could look like. 

My thinking was to bring him on as a co-founder / limited partner while I retain the CEO / Founder moniker. Given that the company can start generating revenue quickly I figured it might make more sense to offer a profit sharing program instead of a traditional vested equity offer that takes years to see the upside. This not only provides him with a wuick ROI but also provides me the bonus of me keeping control of the company and not having to dish out equity (especially as this person will not be working full time on the business). 

My proposal at the moment is as follows

50% of net profits to the partner for all sales of his own self-branded digital product

10% of net profits to the partner for all sales of digital products from notable figures he onboards to the company (IE: If he sets up a meeting a high-profile ""influencer"" who signs a deal with us to create their digital products on our platform, the partner gets 10% of those sales)

An alternate structure that came to mind is to have somewhat similar profit sharing numbers as these, but then to also offer a small piece of milestone based equity (lets say 5% - 10%) (IE: Successful launch of the partners self-branded digital product = 3%, hitting over 100k rev on the product = another 2%, successful on-boarding of high profile figure = an additional 3%, etc).

Curious to know what you guys think on this kind of structure? Also, does it make sense to give my mentor the co-founder / partner title given all the variables listed above? Would a Multi-Member LLC, partnership, or S-Corp make more sense for the business formation?

Pardon the long post. Although I am very experienced in the creation of the digital product we will be offering I am not particularly experienced with partnerships &amp; business structures so I am seeking some general feedback to further formalize my thoughts before I spend money on legal / financial experts (which will certainly be the next step).

46,What would you do?,"Hey guys, hope you're all staying safe during these trialing times!

I had a couple questions I was hoping some of you with more experience building and shipping startups could help me get answers to.

So I'm in the process of building a p2p ecomm marketplace for a very specific niche space. The space does roughly \~10k transactions per month at an average $130.00/item. We'll be taking roughly 0.06% &amp; processing fees for each transaction. The current avenue for sales are forums &amp; reddit, which I think our platform can be a great upgrade to in terms of features and visibility. The barrier of entry is also absurd - so we will help lower that tremendously.

With that said I do not have any experience in marketing. I am a firm believer in the ""I rather have a piece of something, than the entirety of nothing"" mindset. I have no problem partnering with people who can bring value - I simply want to put my company in the best position to succeed.

Thus, I am at a crossroads. We are about 40-50% way through the development of the MVP (team of 3) working on this as a side project. So I have naturally been thinking alot about the business side since I feel it'll come up quicker than expected.

**I had this idea the other day, hear me out:**

There is a small company (2 people) in the space that is highly respected, delivers great products, has great branding, and has already established a very large social media presence. They're behind the hottest products in the space. I'm considering pitching them a merger, if you will. We bring an advanced technology platform that can bring in a massive revenue stream (much larger than their existing), while they bring the brand, business acumen, and connections. I believe together we can get this thing rolling and in a direction that can really take over the space.

What would you guys do in my situation? Take on the challenge yourself with your team of tech-savvy people? Or pitch the merge with a company that is established and can give us very large head-start in the roll out while taking on the business side while we continue to tackle the tech side.",startups,1586891562,col0rcutclarity,6,6,True,2020-04-14

84,Resigning on good terms (in the middle of coronavirus),"So i've worked at this startup for the last 6 months. Since joining, our core team has remained as the two co-founders and me. I haven't had an official job description throughout so have been working on almost every aspect of the company- especially in the first 3 months where my bosses both had other full-time jobs. So it's been a lot of lonely hours and self-motivated work.

I joined and love this company because it's one of the few in my city/country working to tackle environment-societal issues in an efficient way. It's very difficult to find meaningful jobs in sustainability in Pakistan, and so the low salary after university graduation was not a deterrent at the time. I was hoping to help the company reach a point of sustaining itself within 3-6 months, and we were nowhere close to that before coronavirus, and now we're in an even worse position. I was hoping to pick up many new skills and areas of responsibility and give my all to this company.

Instead, I feel like i've learned how NOT to run a business. My bosses are not mentors, even though they're very nice people. I am not learning anything new or doing anything exciting. 

I feel really bad about wanting to abandon the company, and there are also zero job prospects at the moment because of coronavirus. So as it stands, the present is very bleak with being skeptical about any ideas/plans my bosses create and a 50% pay cut (down to $102/month)......and the future doesn't seem any brighter.... and it hurts the most when you're trying to make any sort of progress for your country towards sustainability and it is just not happening.

106,Starting my journey - Launching a website question,"Hello guys,

I have been thinking about a personal project that I could work on during my days at home to gain some experience in the process. The personal project I have in mind is a gaming news and review website that I would really like to work on. However, I have never created my own website before and although I've been learning a bit more about Python lately, I still lack programming experience. 

I am willing to do the research and learning necessary for this, but I would like to be as efficient as possible in how to approach this from the start. For example, is the best approach to creating this website through actual web development or is there some much more time-efficient yet useful way such as a service (for example Squarespace). As an example, a website like IGN is similar to what I would like to aim for, with eventually having a login feature and a mobile app connected to the website in the future. 

Are there any useful resources that you have used when starting out on your own project? I would love to hear your advice / suggestions described briefly without too much details if possible. I can then spend the rest of my time doing research and executing based on your suggestions, which would really help me understand and learn a part of the whole launching a project/startup process. 

Sorry if a lot of this is vague, I really hope that you can understand what I mean. Not having a mentor or someone to ask questions means I have to turn to a community that can hopefully give some insights. Excited to be part of this subreddit! Any comments, suggestions, feedback or criticism is welcome!

**Conclusion:**

I want to launch a gaming news website similar to IGN. 

1) What is the most efficient way to start building such a website? (I am currently learning Python. If I can use it for this, that would be a huge plus for my learning experience) :). 

2) What are other technical things I should keep in mind or think about with regards to starting a website, having a login feature, and/or having a mobile app for this in the future?

115,The possibility of succeeding outside UK or USA is 0?,"*This is personal experience and opinion, it might not be correct.*

I was working on several startups of my own. Some of them were really startups, like an app or website doing something, solving something. I spent time with my team trying to get funding, trying to promote it, get some feedback...

I approached each project differently and trying different things from the start. With some I was looking for customers first, with some I was looking for funding first, with some promotion...

I took time and energy so I switched to short term project. Projects that live for few months, they get attention, you sell something and it dies off. Something that is [different and unique](https://dailyblogtips.com/10-crazy-online-ideas-that-actually-worked/). 

Since I live in EU country (Croatia) possibility of going viral outside of Croatia is low, possibility of mouth to mouth marketing is low, people are not interested into something different. I created a project which was different, I couldn't find that someone tried that before.

I contacted Croatian portals, from smaller to bigger, simultaneously I was contacting UK portals. Corona struck and everyone's attention switched to that.

In the meantime I created crypto project. Development took like a month for both projects so I spent most of the time contacting people and portals.

I got zero response from Croatian, UK  and crypto portals. I tried different approaches. I sent emails to specific people, to portals' general email addresses, I send different kind of emails from personal to professional. Why? I don't know. Maybe they saw foreign name, maybe they didn't like the project/story... who knows

After so many tries with different approaches and different projects I stopped and asked myself: ""Can you even succeed outside UK/USA?""

The problem : Financing! I don't have the personal funds to build these and most banks are hesitant to offer loans.

PS : I did a ""soft launch"" with a Craigslist post. Listing at $1150 a month for a cabin I have two people who want to rent them ... But I don't have any cabins!

The last refund/chargeback was in October 2019.

It‚Äôs negative $43,800. 

What‚Äôs odd is that except for one phone call to my house in October they haven‚Äôt contacted me at all. I‚Äôve been calling them more than they‚Äôve been calling me. 

The account is closed/charged off (I can‚Äôt log in either), but every time I call and ask for the contact info of the collections agency they sent it to I‚Äôm told they are still holding it with their in house collections. 

Customer service has no answers. 

I want to set up a payment plan that‚Äôs 24 to 36 months long, but because they are not a bank they don‚Äôt offer payment plans. That‚Äôs why I was waiting for them to send it to collections

I don‚Äôt even mind setting up a payment plan for the entire balance. I just want SOMETHING in place where I‚Äôm paying it off so I can sleep at night. This not knowing is killing me 

It‚Äôs just a regular PayPal business account that went negative, so there‚Äôs no interest rate.

They also can‚Äôt tell me when it will be sent to collections.

142,Question about pricing,"Hi! I have an item that I sell for $40 each (with a profit margin of 45-50%), previously my prices were $34.99 per item, however due to an rise in the cost to supply,  I had to raise the price (to $40). I previously had a deal where if you buy 3 you get 5% off, and if you buy 6 you get 10% off. This worked out pretty nicely, with 3 being around $99, and 6 being around $188. 

However with the price change, 3 is going to be $114 ($120 before the 5% off) and 6 would be $216 ($240 before the $10 off). 

My main problem is when people buy multiple items, I really hate losing that $99 and $188. Putting the 3 at $99 is not something I'd really like to do, as I'd be at a 33% margin (making around 1¬Ω profit that I would make on the sale of one item). However I'm wondering if it would be worth it to put the $216 to $199, this would be a margin of 34%, (making around 3¬Ω profit of what I would on the sale of one item).

I think what I'm really asking, is how much is $199 better then $200. I don't sell a ton of this item, but would it be worth losing $16 to drop it to $199? I also like to offer coupons to interested customers, so then it might even be cheaper.

The way I understand it is... in Delaware, once you form your corporation (default C-corp), the Incorporator has to designate a director, and then resign from the company.  For us, the Incorporation agency did this but did not designate me, the founder, as a director.  Nor was any ""Action by Incorporator"" filed with Delaware.

So that's the first question I have.  How do I ensure that everything I do from here on out is not invalidated?  Is it just in the bylaws?  What do I put in the bylaws exactly?  I can just kind of make it up?  Again, I'm really sorry if I'm irking those that already know all the answers to this question and the next one I'm about to ask.

In the Certificate of Incorporation, it's stated that 25 Million common shares are authorized, and I decided not to specify classes.  How can I now specify classes, such as Class A with voting, Class B without voting, and Preferred Class?  Do I just list that in the Bylaws?  Do I amend the COI?  I'm a bit embarrassed just to ask because I am so nervous about being ridiculed here.

147,Dealing with doubts after building early version,"Hey everyone, I'm a new founder, currently working on a project, but am feeling anxious.

I've been building out the product for around 3 weeks now, while also showcasing the landing page to people and getting emails.

I've finally built a version of the product which I feel solves the problem I am targeting but am still doubting my self and not sure of the next stage.

I have an email list of around 15 people but before sending the product to them I was thinking of getting some other people to try it so I can find out about bugs etc, however that process of getting those users is being very difficult.

The email list mostly consists of people that have the problem and want the solution I've built, so it validates the idea to me, as well as me having the problem myself.

But when I pitch the idea to friends, and other people on reddit/communities I get some answers like ""why would I need this when I can just do x"", which makes me question if it is even a good idea and that I need to add more features to make it worthy to people, but I know that the feature list will be endless and I need to start shipping my product.

Just a bit confused, should I continue trying to talk to people individually and get them on board(build up my ability to sell) or should I just start reaching out to my mailing list subscribers, and then using other channels to promote the product.

tldr; have some validation for the product, some people say they would definitely use it, others think it isn't necessary, have a mailing list of people that want it, not sure whether to add more features, reach out to more people or just get people on my mailing list to use it and then spread it from there",startups,1587005165,Fighter010101,4,2,True,2020-04-15

* Two Engineers
* Two Graphic Designers
* One Analyst (me)
* One Marketing Manager

CEO, CTO and COO are the ones who came up with the idea and we just started working for them without any contract or anything. There are no official docs signed by anyone and basically all of us are contributing our time and efforts for free so far.  


I had a chat with CEO (my friend) about the equity today and he said that we will have a meeting to decide what everyone is going to get out of this.

However, here‚Äôs the interesting part. There is a subcategory in the industry worth about $7B with a lot better margins. A lot companies that are online offer the service and a majority don‚Äôt because it‚Äôs a very complex thing to manufacture (though we can do it).

The subcategory has a very high trust factor involved because quality matters a LOT. 

Do we niche and only offer subcategory or do we serve the whole industry like other companies?



My biggest concern to niche in the subcategory is:


Customers may not come to us because we don‚Äôt offer other products since lot of times they‚Äôre both bundled together.


Concern to not niche:

178,Trouble figuring out a fair equity split,"A few months ago, I started a student entrepreneurship (essentially a sole trader business) at 22 years old, offering a variety of IT services (think VoIP, small scale ERP &amp; CRM software, basic cloud solutions) alongside your run-of-the-mill SMMA activities (mainly helping small business get set up). 

The main goal was quite simple: substitute two student jobs I was working with a business activity profitable enough to bring in a similar amount of money.

I've managed to hit that goal already.

I have now been approached by my brother-in-law, who already is a successful business owner with an offer: **him and his business partner want to pay for the startup of a C-corp, along with a few costs to allow for me to scale my business up (partnerships &amp; initial partner fees for e.g. amazon aws) totaling close to 20000 euros.** 

Beside the money, they would help me out by representing me to potential clients, and leveraging their networks to acquire new leads for me and get more clients on board. They believe in the idea, and want to see where I can take it.

**In exchange, they would like a stake in the company - and are asking me to come up with an offer.** 

Some factors I am considering: 

* Finding new customers is challenging for me, as I mainly want to do B2B services and I don't really have a corporate 'network' yet.
* I can do the work I do in evenings and weekends (outside conventional business hours). However, I have found that meeting potential customers is difficult because I am busy with uni during the day. This would help that problem as they can make time during the day.
* I find the idea of taking this step up alone quite daunting - their support would be welcome

Now for the tough question: **What is a fair equity split?**

All I bring in is technical knowledge and skills (ability to do the actual work) and they bring in sales experience and money. I was considering offering them a 75/25 split where they get the lesser share to split between themselves.

To me this amount seems fair, given the fact the operational part of the company would fall entirely onto my shoulders initially until cashflow is sufficient to hire staff. Also, I am well aware of the fact that without this offer, it would take me years to work up the money and courage to take the plunge.

Strangely this month we have seen a higher ratio between ""sessions"" to ""signup"" when comparing to previous months.

247,Taking a multi-million dollar foreign startup to Europe. What JV setup?,"*Posted this in* r/legaladvice *but I have realized that this is more of a business than a legal question.*

Foreign startup asked me to establish their presence in Europe.

They have no presence in Europe and very little customer base here. 90% of their customers are based out of the US.

They are keen on entering a JV type of relationship with me. I would provide my own work and open the market for them, with no additional workforce required for the time being. Think of me as their own Managing Director Europe, who's paid on a performance basis (e.g. revenue, profit share and equity).

The company though would benefit internationally from my Marketing expertise as they would roll out my own market strategies to their US market too.

What is the best JV setup that:

1. Allows me to risk the least I can if things go wrong
2. Allows me to participate in any EU JV proceeding, whether this is revenue share or profit
3. Allows me to have equity participation in the mother entity and benefit from its destiny (e.g. imagine that through my efforts we dramatically grow the business in Europe and internationally too, and the owner decides to sell for $XX Million). Perhaps this could be based on milestone achievements.
4. Allows the mother entity to co-invest into the European JV to share operational costs

I was wondering if any of you went through a similar structured type of partnership and if you had any advice (or resource) to formalize this in the most mutually beneficial way.

291,How do you deal with scaling your company during a pandemic while also staying sane???,"How do you deal with growing pains and the mental exhaustion from having to scale at lightning speed?

Let me start this off by saying I know my circumstances could be much worse and I am by no means complaining about what‚Äôs going on - but I am certainly still stressed and unsure of how to feel. 

Backstory: I have been working on a SaaS startup for the past two years, and we officially launched this past fall. It was going well, slow growth but still growth. Then all of the sudden, about a month ago, we became a very essential tool due to COVID-19. We had to scale insanely fast and therefore had to cut corners, so last week when our user base went up by 300%, we crashed several times. It felt like the end of the world. I had anxiety attacks all week long, constantly waking up in the middle of the night to check if it had crashed again. We spent tons of money super fast to fix these growing pain issues, and we‚Äôve somehow cobbled together a temporary fix and a plan for a long term solution, as well. These people could easily just go use a competitor who is more mature but (for the most part) they‚Äôre sticking with us which gives me some solace. But now I have to deal with scaling my entire company at a speed I never thought possible in the middle of a pandemic. 

On top of that, I just feel so terrible that all of these people who are relying on us are experiencing this shitty intermittent service. It‚Äôs not the worst thing in the world to have a slow load time or not the most optimal UI, but I can‚Äôt seem to release my fears of people hating us forever because of a bad first impression. You‚Äôre supposed to be embarrassed of your first release or else you‚Äôve done it too late, but man is it hard to actually deal with that in practice. I know sometimes you have to ‚Äúlet fires burn‚Äù in the beginning, but how did you cope mentally with growing pains and having to ignore the perfectionist voice in your head? 

How do you begin to deal with the stress of your startup actually working the way you wanted it to? How do you come to terms with the fact that you can‚Äôt put out every fire and make everyone happy?

These three materials have one theme tying them together, although ironically, for some of the materials, in a roundabout way.

&gt;The gospel of this book, which should be obvious by now, is the strategic advantage gained in the roundabout way

#### [The Berkshire Hathaway Annual¬†Letters](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html)

I spent the last few months reading every annual letter Warren Buffett wrote for Berkshire Hathaway going back to 1965. The reasons I did this were two-fold.

The first is that there is *a lot* of talk surrounding what Warren Buffett did, does, says, and said in investment circles, and I figured I‚Äôd get it straight from the horse‚Äôs mouth given how often his verbiage is quoted. I‚Äôd also been watching all the previous annual meetings that had been recorded on YouTube so I was already a follower and to some mild extent a practitioner.

While I‚Äôm on this point, I‚Äôll mention that since reading his letters I‚Äôve seen a *great deal* of misinformation spread from people who don‚Äôt know anything about Buffett‚Äôs approach. I often see things he stated in letters years ago taken out of context to support an investment thesis that Buffett would not approve of. As an aside, this is one of the most underrated advantages of learning. The more you learn, the more you realize how full of shit other people can be. Smelling bullshit is imperative to success, but I digress.

The second is, Warren Buffett is a legendary investor. It seems reasonable that if you want to achieve an even remote amount of his success, learning everything you can from him would be beneficial. As they say, ‚Äúshoot for the moon, land on the stars‚Äù. This same approach is what led me to be accepted to the [Berklee College of Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berklee_College_of_Music) when trying to be accepted to Juilliard or to accept an offer from Amazon when trying to get into Google.

One of the important things you‚Äôll uncover in these letters is Buffett‚Äôs patient, methodical, and disciplined approach to his early insurance business. Year after year in the early letters he states that other insurance businesses are chasing returns and that Berkshire‚Äôs insurance business will not write business that doesn‚Äôt make financial sense just because the other firms are doing it. Berkshire‚Äôs insurance business was more than willing to sit and do *nothing* for some years while in business.

&gt;It is our policy not to lay off people because of the large fluctuations in work load produced by such voluntary volume changes. We would rather have¬†  
some slack in the organization from time to time than keep¬†  
everyone terribly busy writing business on which we are going to¬†  
lose money.

Let that sync in, Buffett was willing to pay a staff of insurance personnel to do *nothing* all year if the business they would have been writing would not compensate them for the risks they were taking. Like most risk-based markets, Buffett knew that the insurance industry was cyclical and that the insurance businesses currently underwriting poor business and driving down margins for the rest of the market would go bust, the margins would then return to normal, and in some cases abnormal in the patient practitioner‚Äôs favor.

#### [The Dao Of¬†Capital](https://www.amazon.com/Dao-Capital-Austrian-Investing-Distorted/dp/111834703X)

This idea of the *roundabout investor* was explicitly stated in Mark Spitznagel‚Äôs book The Dao of Capital. In it, he outlines the advantages of a roundabout strategy that can be found through history, from Coniferous trees to [Laozi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi) and [Clausewitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_von_Clausewitz). The idea here is that the most direct and obvious route to victory is seldom a route to victory at all. Laozi called it *Shi* vs. *Li*.

&gt;Simply stated, li goes for the immediate outcome of every battle, while shi seeks first the positional advantage of the¬†setup.

Often the surest route to victory, surprisingly, is through indirect means and patience. This is similar to Buffett‚Äôs approach of letting the insurance business come to him when the time was right, rather than chasing future losses in a frenzy. Spitznagel would call this *roundabout investing*. *When taking this approach it becomes imperative to understand the second and third-order effects of events, to capitalize on these indirect effects when the time comes.*

#### [The Indie Hackers¬†Podcast](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast)

This leads me to the final set of material I‚Äôve been consuming. I‚Äôve been on a tear listening to every [Indie Hacker‚Äôs Podcast](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast) I can get my hands on. I‚Äôm currently over 2/3rds of the way through all the podcast episodes and have learned an absurd amount from all of the entrepreneurs that have been on the podcast. However, the most topical to this post is the idea of what I‚Äôm calling the *roundabout entrepreneur*.

What has been most eye-opening to me about so many of these successful entrepreneurs is how long their businesses have been in operation in order to achieve the success they have. Prior to listening to the podcast, I was one of the sorry souls who thought you either had an overnight success viral mobile app or you had nothing, and since a few of my odd side projects hadn‚Äôt gone viral they weren‚Äôt worth pursuing further and were abandoned altogether.

Some of the entrepreneurs who‚Äôve been on the podcast have made the off-hand comment similar to ‚Äúyeah, we launched on product hunt and after the initial traction had to follow it up with content-marketing‚Äù. [Courtland](https://twitter.com/csallen) himself mentions a number of times that these one-off stunts usually don‚Äôt maintain growth and you typically can‚Äôt build a sustainable business around them.

To build a defensible sustainable business takes time, patience, determination, and discipline. If you are an overnight success, the chances are that you will not continue to be a success far into the future if you haven‚Äôt built the business chops to continue to operate correctly. Businesses take time (or capital) to grow. It‚Äôs as simple as that, and no amount of gimmicks or features is going to change that.

Once you accept that building a sustainable business takes time, and there isn‚Äôt anything you can do about that,\* *it becomes imperative to understand the second and third-order effects of events, to capitalize on these indirect effects when the time comes. Shi* vs*. Li.* Because time is so important to the entrepreneurial process you have to be sure that what you‚Äôre working on has the ability to grow and be of worthwhile value far into the future and not just now. This is the idea of the *roundabout entrepreneur*.

\*aside from diluting your equity, raising a round of funding, and throwing money at the business to speed the growth of course. However, if you haven‚Äôt steered the boat in a *roundabout* way, you may be steering it full steam ahead into a cliff.",startups,1587223985,binaryfor,1,1,True,2020-04-18

316,"A startup story about culture, technology and money","Hello everyone,

Today I'd like to tell you the story of the startup I've been a part of for the past 3 years, initially as co-founder and CTO and now sole owner and also CEO.

It all started out in 2017, when my best friend called me up to meet because he had a great app idea that will turn into a profitable business. We met downtown for a coffee and he passionately told me about what was keeping him up at night. The idea came to him during his last visit to the barber. While he was cutting his hair, the barber started small talking and asked him what he did for a job. After he'd told him that he was working as a programmer, the barber asked him if he would be willing to make him a website for his clients to book appointments with him online, because he was going crazy with all of them calling his personal phone number. That's when my friend realized that probably most barbers have this problem and that we should build a platform where all of them could register a profile and people could search and book any one of them.

After a few weeks of fantasizing about the idea, we decided to go full in, quit our 9-5 jobs and started working on an MVP. Right from the start, we had to decide what our roles would be. As I had a lot more programming experience, we agreed that only I was going to work on the tech side and be the CTO and he would start learning everything else, marketing, sales etc and be the CEO.

Fast forward a couple of months, the MVP was ready and we were going to onboard our first barbershops and start beta testing. One unique selling point of our platform was that we required users to fill in their phone numbers which we validated with an SMS short code send to their devices. This was to make sure people wouldn't make fake appointments from accounts created using random email addresses.

Seeing how our company was bootstrapped, we didn't have much money to spend so our core value was to build everything as cheap as possible or FREE. With that in mind, we had a problem in sending the SMS codes for validating user phone numbers. We couldn't use an API because that would get expensive pretty quick. So we decided to SCIENCE THE SHIT OUT OF IT. I started looking for ways to build a cheap SMS server and use a prepaid SIM card to send out messages. In about a week I had a working system that used a RaspberryPi and a 3G USB dongle (which can be used to also send SMS using some open source software). This was a great and cheap solution and most importantly, IT WORKED. 

A few months after our release, we were having problems getting users on the platform. Most of them found it easier to just call for an appointment. From a technical perspective there was nothing wrong with the software, so we started investigating why users found it hard to use. This wasn't hard because most of them had the same complaint. They either didn't have an email address in order to be able to register an account or, if they did manage to sign up, the next time they wanted to book a haircut and had to log in again, they forgot their passwords and could not get into their account. This is when my partner suggested that we ditch emails altogether and use phone numbers as primary keys for user accounts and log them in with SMS codes. At first, I was outraged. Not using an email and password for user accounts seemed absurd, a blasphemy. But after some talks, I was also convinced this was the way to go and went on to modify the platform. And surely enough, IT WORKED. User signups were through the roof and we started on boarding even more barbershops. Everyone now found the app easier to use than calling for an appointment. Looking back at this I've learned my lesson. Most of us programmers are so hung up on best practices/ideologies and we can't think about UX for shit. 

The key lesson from the switch to SMS and ditch the emails is to know your audience. I was so against it at first because all of my career I've worked with email+password based authentication. All of the apps I saw were using it, every tutorial I've ever read about programming had this way of logging  users in. But the thing I've always failed to notice was that most of that literature was coming from the US (or some other developed country like UK etc). But we were deploying an app in an eastern Europe country. The average user here doesn't use email because he has no need for it in his day to day life. The majority of people here pay for stuff using cash and most of them are against using credit cards because in our language, card written backwards is drac, which literally means the devil. If you're building apps targeted at similar cultures, mostly third and second world countries, I can't stress this enough, use phone numbers instead of emails as user IDs, you'll thank me later.

Alright, now that we had a solid product that people loved to use, it was time for disaster to strike. The SIM cards we were using to send SMS messages from got blocked by the carrier. At that point we used 3 of those raspberry boxes to load balance traffic. But we were sending around 5000 SMSs a month and phone companies frown on that :). They won't allow SMS bots to use their regular SIM cards. For that you'd have to sign up for a company subscription which was pretty costly and we could not afford it. All hell broke loose, we were at a dead end. We had no money to be able to use an SMS API like Twilio. That night I didn't sleep. I had to come up with a cheap or FREE solution to this. That's when I found [Facebook Account Kit](https://www.accountkit.com/), a service build exactly for what we needed. It allowed developers to validate phone numbers using a short code sent to users' phone numbers via SMS or WhatsApp. And the best part of it? It was FREE for the first 100k messages. This was a life saver and it worked great .. for a while.

Fast forward one year later, I got an email from Facebook Account Kit that they were going to shut down the service in 3 months time. Oh boy, here we go again. At this point, our service was making \~3000$ in income each month and we were two employees. The money barely covered our salaries, government taxes and other costs like server hosting. And also our user base had doubled and now we were sending \~10.000 SMS messages using Facebook Account Kit each month. That volume would have cost us about 600$ if we were to switch to Twilio. Hello darkness, my old friend! I had to pun on my thinking hat and SCIENCE THE SHIT OUT OF IT again. I had 3 months to come up with a solution and implement it. And the gods have favored me again. I had an ""AHA"" moment which, in my mind, was similar to the time Isaac Newton was hit in the head by the apple and the idea came to me. What if we don't send SMS messages to the users, but require them to send one to prove they own that phone number? I immediately started prototyping this and found out that it can be done. In both Android and IOS you can open the default SMS app with the to and body fields pre filled. The only thing the user has to do is hit send. He doesn't even have to fill in his phone number, because it is inferred by the receiving end. This was an awesome solution, the UX was great, users can log in with only 2 taps and we move the costs to them, which isn't a problem because most users have unlimited messaging. Seeing how 90% of our traffic is coming from mobile devices this would cut our costs by 90%. And we'd offer a fallback for desktop users where we'd send the code to them.

And IT WORKED! We've been running on this system since January. We did have a couple of complaints and a few users who we're confused by this, but eventually they caught on. We run this system through an Android tablet which runs our custom proxy app. We receive \~2-300 messages daily and send about 500 each month (we also use this to send codes for users on desktop). All with a pre paid SIM card that is costing us $7/month.

So far it seems stable and should be future proof, but you never know :).",startups,1587243954,drakedemon,104,25,True,2020-04-18

324,"Current high school junior, interested in gaining technical experience in the startup environment while in HS--need some advice","Hi everyone

I'm currently in junior in HS, and for the past year I've invested a lot of time into learning coding and projects; also, given the situation with COVID, I have nothing but time to develop these skills for the foreseeable future

I am interested in learning/gaining experience aside from just technical skills, such as gaining real work experience, as well as learning about how startups run first hand, in addition to the myriad other things that are immediately relevant to real-world software development outside that *arent* just writing code.

My question is first, will interning (or volunteering, whatever you call it) at a startup help me learn about these skills and will it ultimately be a useful experience for someone who is interested in pursuing computer science in college and likely a related career in future? Or, will my time be better spent elsewhere?

Secondly, I am curious as to how I might go about beginning this. I got this idea of working at local startups by the recommendation of my CS prof at the community college I am concurrently taking classes at. I live in area where there is a decent amount of tech startups but I don't live in the big tech hotspots like San Jose, so I need advice regarding what exactly small startups might be looking for so I can maximize my chances of getting to work with them. I'm not expecting to be able to do much for them as a HS student, but I do want to hone my technical skills beyond just menial work (which has been my experience while working at local research labs; things like ""clean this beaker"", etc).

Finally, would a tech startup even be interested in taking a HS to help intern for them? Like I mentioned earlier, I have a decent amount of experience coding as well as a few CS classes from my local CC under my belt, but clearly this is very little compared to *many* other people. I intend to send emails out asking the local startups regardless, but I want to know what I'm doing first.

332,App prototype built - where to go next?,"Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I came up with an idea I've been working on for the past couple of years (on and off) part time. I taught myself enough Java to built a prototype app that does the basics of what I want it to do. My original intention was to build the entire thing myself and teach myself to program along the way. However to make the app work properly, it would require more than what I can feasibly learn to code without being a professional developer. 

I'm a CFA charterholder and run a small wealth management company full time, so I have various expertise in areas outside of programming. I've allocated $50k I could justify investing into the project, and have the cashflow from my other business to support it as necessary if it has opportunities to become successful. 

One of the things pushed on me at business school was not to try and do everything yourself, to find others whose skill sets compliment your own. This has really pushed me to consider not programming it all myself, as I am already an expert in my current field.

My question is where to go from here. Ideally I would bring on a technical co-founder, and leave myself to act as the business manager/handle the financials. However, I'm acutely aware that technical co-founders are in extremely high demand. 

My other options are to hire a freelancer to build the app, hire a development company, or continue to learn to program part time. 

I've also seen the ability to purchase the source code for another app and modify it to suit my needs (or hire a developer to modify it). The app itself already exists multi times over, but the variation I want to put on it has not been done yet and would be the factor that makes the app successful. I could easily see taking a source code and adding 2 or 3 features being all that is necessary to have a profitable beta version before revamping and investing in new development.

I'm not concerned at all about running the business, or finding additional investors once a working prototype is built as that is currently my full time job.

I'm still a student in its 1st year of a Master living in Italy. My dream is either or getting into Google or start my own business.

Two years ago I started working on a project for a restaurant reservation service, similar to TheFork but more ambitious and most importantly *cheaper* (up to 8 times).

Due to current situations all restaurants are losing money for the lockdown.  
I think that once the lockdown will start to loosen up their intentions is to mitigate as much as possible their loss and maybe some of them will be more willing to use similar services to boost their visibility and recover customers faster. Currently the term of the lockdown for restaurants is planned for the 25th of May.

Currently my product will need around 1 month to be completed. I don't have huge funds, I can't afford more workforce than mine and the other guy interested in the idea. My university has an incubator that offer consulting services for cheap, but they don't give any funds.

For this summer I have an offer from a local startup where I think I can make a great impact due to their size, their relative youth and my knowledge. A thing I know is that impact is the most important factor when Big Tech companies have to choose which candidate interview.

Here it is where I need your advices.

* Thanks to your entrepreneurial experience, could you confirm or disprove my assumptions regarding the possibility from restaurants to use TheFork and similar services once the lockdown will end?
* Should I consider to sacrifice my professional and university career for an attempt to launch a product which has all the credentials to fail, but which exploits a possible opportunity due for the current economic situation?

I don't expect you to have a crystall ball, but I'm in a point where I need a little bit help and advices.

354,How I failed my Product Hunt launch,"For the last month my team mates and I have been turning our travel platform Routitude into a coronavirus monitoring service. We intend to do it only for the time being since traveling is not a good idea right now. I know, there have already been a bunch of apps of this kind. But ours is different, believe me. To put it shortly, it is simply the best one, no less.

Last Monday I launched our service on Product Hunt. It turned out to be a complete fail. Here's what I did:

* Spend a whole day trying to create a cool gif with an open source video editor.
* Prepared some media materials and wrote a casual long first comment.
* Scheduled the post for 00:15 PT because the first google search link recommended so.
* Sent the launch link to some of my friends and did not ask them to upvote it ;)
* Was active on PH website and made a number of comments on other submitted products and makers' threads.

As a result after 20 minutes the submission had been buried under a ton of other posts in the newest section. I think pretty much no one has even seen the preview of the post. 

Here's what I think I did wrong (but not totally sure):

* First of all, let's not fault the gif for it.
* Probably the time I chose was not optimal for my case. I had the idea that the post could only be featured on the front page on the day of its submission. That turned out to be completely wrong and there were many featured products from the evening of the previous day. So my guess is it could be better to post in the evening when the majority of the PH users are not sleeping yet and most of other products have already been submitted following the popular recommendations.
* Continuing on the topic of timing it is worth to note that the competition on Mondays is much higher than on weekends. This means that if you haven't been preparing for the launch for some serious time it might be a good idea to submit on weekends.
* I read in an official PH article that who submits the product doesn't make much difference. Initially I felt that there actually could be some difference, but was persuaded it might not be worth it to make an effort to find a more or less well-known hunter. So I posted the product from my own account which hasn't had much activity since it was created. Lo and behold, I found a similar product posted by a top hunter on the front page. This also might suggest that the coronavirus topic was not necessarily the reason for the fail. I still don't feel like asking someone else to submit but I will definitely boost my own account for the next launch.

355,First interview with an accelerator - should my developer join?,"I finally snagged a first round interview with a startup accelerator. I couldn‚Äôt be more excited but I‚Äôm also quite nervous. 

Some background: I‚Äôm a solo non-tech founder (I know I know.) I teamed up with a seasoned dev who happens to have his own development team. He is not a founder, but I allocated him a very small piece of equity and in exchange he acts as a CTO and I can utilize his dev resources. He is interested in hanging on until we make some money, cashing out, and then moving on. At that point I can either continue giving him my business (at cost) or not. 

This works for me because it allows me to get an MVP out the door, get funding, and then ideally hire an internal team to hand off development to. 

ANYWAY back to the point - is this a person I should include in my interview call? On one hand I want the accelerator to meet him so I can prove we have a solid working relationship and a development plan.

On the other hand, he is a bit of a wildcard. He has a lot of (unsolicited) opinions about what the business plan should look like, how much equity I should give out to an accelerator, etc. Basically he has a lot of thoughts for someone who doesn‚Äôt want to be a founder (I offered and he declined.) I‚Äôm nervous he might spout off about this or that during the call or share thoughts that I don‚Äôt agree with from the business end. 

Basically, he should only be focused on the technical side and I can‚Äôt trust that he will do that during the interview. He‚Äôs a great guy and really awesome to work with other than not having much of a filter when it comes to sharing opinions.

362,How to Grow Your Email List (and Your Online Business) Faster,"Business and email list: two things that take an immense time to grow. 

**So what can you do to grow your email list faster and, at the same time, acquire more clients and grow your online business?**

In this article, I'll show you what I do to speed up this process.

If you want to watch the video version of this post, [click here](https://youtu.be/X-jKLtvTCqc) (and if you feel generous, leave a like :D ).

Since I started building my online business, I've been hearing from online gurus the same thing:¬†**focus on your email list**! ""Get at least 10 subscribers per day!""

So I followed their advice. I spent time creating articles and videos for my Youtube Channel, and in almost each one of them, **I added a content upgrade to grow my email list.**

If you don't know what a content upgrade is, it's a secondary piece of content related to the main topic that people can access, leaving their email address.

If you read my blog, you know what I'm talking about, and spoiler alert, this article has a content upgrade too.

Anyway, the method works to grow an email list.

The only problem in this strategy is that especially when you start, you won't get too much traffic to your content, and so you'll get a couple of email leads per day.

So how can we make our content reach a bigger audience in order to collect more subscribers and clients in the future?

## Automations are overrated

We live in an automated online scenario: evergreen webinars, predefined welcome email series, chatbots...

The concept of passive income made us detach completely from our audience.

And I get it: if you're an authority on the web, you'd probably receive dozens and dozens of messages per day, most of them from weirdos.

It's humanly impossible to get back to all these calls for help.

If you're starting right now, and your business is reasonably small, you paradoxically have an advantage.

You can ask any of your new subscribers to help you grow.

## The Power of genuine connections

Let's picture the situation: you periodically create content, and you offer a lead magnet in each article/video/podcast episode.

How can you make these couple subscribers you get per day grow to 10, 20, or more?

**You simply ask them to help you.**

This technique is so simple, and at the same time, so ignored by the majority of online content creators.

If a person consumed your content and even gave away the email contact to access your content upgrade, this means you really struck a chord.

What about reaching this person, thanking her for getting our lead magnet, and ask for help?

**If you helped her first with your content, she'd probably be up to help you back.** 

This is what I did to skyrocket my email list when I started my YouTube Channel: I got back to each of my new subscribers, thanking them for consuming my content, and asking if they could share my content.

The reason why this method works so well is that, first of all, no one does it. How many times an online expert reached out to you personally to thank you?

These genuine personal messages will build a strong bond with your followers, and they will help you.

In the second instance, you helped this person for free, and asking a favor back isn't that huge request. If these subscribers spent time reading your article or watching your videos, they'd take another 2 minutes to share your content.

## Power up your messages

There are a few rules you need to follow to make your requests to help perform even better.

**#1. Use videos to reach out to these people.** 

I use a tool called [Bonjoro](https://www.alessandrodiruscio.com/bonjoro) that allows me to record a quick video through my phone, wherever I am, and send it straight away to the people who joined my email list.

Receiving a personal email is powerful, **but receiving a video message done just for me is another level.**

I learned this from the founder of Bonjoro,¬†**Matt Barnett**.   
When I joined the software, I received a personal message from Matt. He was walking in the street, drinking a Starbucks coffee. In the video, he thanked me for joining, and he offered his help for any questions I may have.

**#2. Mention your subscribers' names.** 

In his message, Matt mentioned my name immediately so that I could understand that that wasn't an automated message. He took 1 minute of his time making a video just for me, and that blew me away.

\#3. And this is my secret technique, **use a whiteboard to write your subscriber name.** 

Bonjoro sends an email to the subscriber with a screenshot from the 1st second of the video.

**I start all my videos holding the whiteboard with the name of my subscriber, so she knows that the message is addressed to her.**

If you want to start testing this technique, I have a surprise for you. You can watch 3 example videos I sent to subscribers, where I ask them to like my video, share it, and join my Facebook group.

These videos will give you a precise idea of what you should say on the video, length, vibe, etc...

[You can download the 3 videos here](https://www.alessandrodiruscio.com/content-upgrades/3-personal-videos-to-subscribers/).

## Be natural

The important thing you need to remember when you create a video is that **the more it looks natural, the better it will work.**

As I said, Matt Barnett sent me a video while he was walking in the street, with a coffee in his hand.

Pretend the subscriber is an old friend. In that case you wouldn't make your hair, put on makeup, find the perfect light... 

You would just grab the phone, regarding where you are and what you put on, and send a video.

Well, I'd avoid taking a video in the bathroom, but you got the point. Make it natural and drop any script before pressing record.",startups,1587310644,pickupchange,1,1,True,2020-04-19

I have about 2 years experience in background modelling and animation.  I can't create the entire game on my own, therefore, I have brought 3 other people in to help make the game. We are planning to make this game for Steam.

Some people are suggesting I go 25% each as everyone will have their own expertise skill/role that contributes to the game, however, I feel I contribute a little more. Here I will mention everyones role also considering it was my idea to build this game and bring together the team.

**Me:** \*Individually selected them to be a part of the team.   
\*Game Story idea, concept, map, levels, etc. .\*Game 3D graphics. \* Animation. \*Background modelling &amp; rendering. \*Game effects. 

**Person 2:** \*Game Story plan, idea, concept, map, levels, etc.   
\*Character modelling. \*Animation (In the process of learning, no experience)

**Person 3:** \*Game programmer (learned 2 years programming college).

**Person 4:** \*Concept Art (Background and character). \*2D Art. **Very good!** **Original character sketches are incredible.**  Top tier Art School student.

377,A question for those interested in working with startups from the VC side of the table.,"COVID-19 has ultimately left me with about 15% more time in my day, so I figured I'd put that to good use. I'm curious about those browsing this subreddit with both an interest in both entrepreneurship and the funding side of the ecosystem (VCs). 

I've worked in VC for a few years now, in a very new space, and noticed a lack of ""getting started"" information available for people who found themselves at a VC fund as an analyst or other early role. 

If you have an interest in the VC side of the startup environment, I'm wondering:

1. Are you here to learn about entering the VC industry? Or are you here to learn about how VCs are behaving in certain investment verticals?
2. If you're learning about entering the VC industry, what kind of information do you feel is lacking to you? 

I'd love to start a dialogue here and get people involved with a centralized resource. I know I wish I had found one. Even if there's fewer people here exploring the VC side of the startup ecosystem, I think any more insight into the VC side of the table would be useful.",startups,1587320069,roketship,1,1,True,2020-04-19

411,Don't pretend that a market leader doesn't exist. Use them to your advantage instead,"Pretending that a popular competitor and a market leader doesn't exist is something I've noticed some startups do. I believe that's a mistake. And here's a quick story on why and how we used this to break website traffic and trial signup records for the startup I'm working on.

You've probably in the past entered a home page of a startup and immediately understood the market they are trying to serve and the big competitor they're up against. In your head, you're probably comparing what you see on their site to what you know about the competitor too. 

But on their home page, there's no mention of that competitor at all and no clear positioning against them. They're not trying to help you figure out what differentiates them and makes them better from the product that you already know.

It's a mistake we've made with the startup I'm working on. We're building a website stats tool and before couple of weeks ago we didn't focus on the fact that Google Analytics exists and that most of the people who may want to consider our product have at least some experience using Google Analytics. Google Analytics is installed on the majority of websites after all.

We fixed that. We made a change to our website and positioned ourselves directly and clearly against Google Analytics on the aspects where we think they're not doing as well and where we think we might have a better solution for some site owners at least.

From using Google Analytics ourselves in the past to speaking to other Google Analytics users, we came up with several different categories and pain points where we believe we have a valid alternative:

* Ease of use - Google Analytics is famous for having hundreds of different reports/metrics and many people struggle understanding and getting value from it. Our tool gives all metrics at a glance.

* Website speed - Google Analytics tracks a lot of data so if you insert their scripts on your site, it may affect the page loading speed. Our tool is 1.4 KB only so tiny impact on site speed.

* Privacy regulations - Google Analytics uses cookies and tracks personal data so your site needs to have cookie banner and prompts to get GDPR consent too. Our tool is compliant with the privacy regulations out of the box.

Then we just made these things very clear on our home page and even published a blog post with reasons why we believe site owners should [stop using Google Analytics](https://plausible.io/blog/remove-google-analytics). 

This repositioning move and the blog post itself has pretty much changed the traction of the startup. It has been a great success for us and broke all of our site traffic records and trial signup records too. We got hundreds of comments via email, forums and social media. Some influential figures including Rand Fishkin and April Dunford shared our post. Other startups reached out to collaborate with us and there‚Äôs even an invite to be a guest on a popular podcast.

**So the lesson I've learned that I hope to see more startups use as well is not to hide the fact that a popular competitor and a market leader exists. People do know and they will mentally put you up against them while browsing your site whether you want it or not.** 

Rather than pretending that a market leader doesn‚Äôt exist, use their existence to your advantage:

* Clearly explain the differences between your product and the biggest player on the market. 

* Publish comparison posts where you go into the detail on these differences. 

* List reasons why your major competitor is flawed and explain what makes your solution a viable alternative.

* Find some areas where the market leader is lacking and design a replacement and an alternative with a focus on those. 

* You should not try to design a clone, a full-blown replacement and a feature-by-feature reproduction of the market leader. You don‚Äôt need to cover all the different use-cases of the most popular product. Cover a few that the market leader doesn‚Äôt care much about.

This will help you easier get your message across to people.

Is there a situation like this in your industry where it makes sense for you to put your startup up against a market leader? If not necessary upfront and central on your home page then how about some type of comparison page or ""alternative to"" post? Or have you done something similar in the past and what are the results you've seen?

If you're interested, I wrote a [summary](https://plausible.io/blog/blog-post-changed-my-startup) of our process and steps we've taken to reposition ourselves including all the numbers we achieved.",startups,1587390835,markoblog,28,1,True,2020-04-20

Am a newbie programmer interested in android app development i spent more than 6 months learning and practicing programming languages such as JAVA, PYTHON, HTML, C.

Now that i have successfully completed all cources on these languages i don't see how they are related to the app industry and the apps we use in a day to day manner.

1) From where do i start &amp; how many codes do i need &amp; where exactly should i put my code ? 

2) Lets say i wanna make an app do my six month experience is enough or is there a period of time i should spent learning &amp; practicing before making my first project ?

3) Is making an app all depends on coding &amp; programming languages or is there any other things do i need to learn first in order to start ? 

4) Is learning one language enough or many languages participate in android app development ?

5) Can i make a full app by my own or do i need a team &amp; how many number of programmer is ideal to make one successful app ?

6) Is my laptop enough for making the app or do i need many laptops &amp; other tools ?

7) And if i wanna program the app totally by my self do i need money to make the app or my coding knowledge is sufficient &amp; if iam willing to put money on the app what ways can money benifit the app (besides hiring freelancer &amp; affiliate markiters) ? do online platforms &amp; cloud apps need more cash &amp; why ?

8) And finally if all these questions depends on the type of the app i wanna make how are today's top apps like social media...etc defers from the other millions of apps in the store, is it because the number of people who participate in making them or the level of experience thoes people have, or is it simply money, or they are just good at markiting or are they any other aspects that am not aware of that make the app successful in the terms of programming &amp; so (besides the idea) ?

9) And if i wanna start an online app buisness do i need to know everything or the buisness aspects (MARKETING / INVESTING / MANAGEMENT) are more important than the tech aspects ( CODING / DESIGNING) So should i spent more time learning or should i just hire freelancer who have well experience &amp; let them handle the work while i concern myself with the buisness issues ?

440,It is possible (perhaps required) to pivot during COVID,"A month ago I created a post where I walked businesses through how to deal with this completely new environment. [1]

The key proposition was that it‚Äôs possible to survive and if you‚Äôre resourceful enough, even thrive.

Boy oh boy... that went down about as well as showing up naked to prom night,
covered in baby oil screaming ‚Äòthey‚Äôll never catch me‚Äô.

Well, we‚Äôre a month down the line and the results are in. There absolutely are businesses that have been able to use this situation to their advantage and massively grow their bottom line. 

(Hopefully, some of those people have adjusted their decision making framework accordingly but something tells me certain people are more motivated by a negativity circle-jerk than optimizing for finding the truth.)

BUT, and it‚Äôs a big but, it did require a total reassessment of the business model.

Some companies just lucked out, zoom, netflix, the consumer bread baking industry, board game makers, instacart, doordash etc. But relying on hope makes for a poor strategy. 

So questions need to be asked:

What‚Äôs my new value proposition? What‚Äôs my new user base? What‚Äôs my delivery channel? My vendors? My revenue stream? Or we talking about a pivot? Or are wel talking about a fundamentally different business? And so on.

In that thread there was a clear separation between positive minded people and negative minded ones. (It‚Äôs easier to complain than to to come up with solutions.)

E.g. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not spending money therefore no one is spending money‚Äù type of logic (False Consensus effect in social psychological terms.) (Pelham, 2019).

I suspect the former are people that run real companies (forced out of necessity to overcome their emotions and come up with solutions) while the latter are probably only studying (no skin in the game), but that‚Äôs merely a hypothesis.

The key takeaway is that: Being a founder is hard enough! Do not let your mind become an extra hurdle to overcome. 

A comedian has 1 job, get on stage and make people laugh.

In the same vein a founder has 1 job, figure out what people will give you money for and then give it to them in exchange for money. 

The people that are mindlessly executing a business model aren‚Äôt founders. [2] That‚Äôs not good or bad, it just is. Those people are useful when the business is essentially nothing more than keeping the revenue engine running. [3]

But when the entire macro environment shifts, it‚Äôs creatives that you need. People that are comfortable with uncertainty. Or at least willing to act despite being uncomfortable.

So here‚Äôs the TLDR: The environment has shifted drastically. Do NOT let this opportunity go to waste. If damage control is the best you can do right now, do damage control. But perhaps it‚Äôs possible to thrive, although it will take some creativity and balls. And lastly, your mindset matters. It‚Äôs clich√© as hell, but self-fulfilling prophecies are a thing. So hang around people you look up to and ax nihilistic defeatist people out your life.

455,Should I accept a freelance position at a competitor‚Äôs CPG food startup?,"I started working on a CPG food idea that I had a couple of months ago. This isn‚Äôt my first startup, though it is my first in food. From my previous startup experience, I know people who have gone down this road and who work as food buyers for retailers like Target that I‚Äôve talked to about this idea‚Äôs viability and so far reaction has been very positive. I‚Äôve created a lengthy checklist for myself to get it off the ground. 

Some additional context - I raised money for my last startup and I didn‚Äôt love the relationship that I had with investors and the pressure for growth that venture capital money comes with. This time, I‚Äôd like to self fund to avoid all of the negatives that come with that. 

Since my last startup, I‚Äôve been freelancing as a consultant in e-commerce/brand. I found a competitor to my CPG food idea that is launching next month (and is venture backed). It‚Äôs not the same idea but definitely in the same wheelhouse. They were looking for a brand consultant for the next three months to see them through their launch, I applied on a whim, interviewed, and was offered the position. 

Is it disingenuous of me to work for them, if largely my motives are to mimic something similar, with my own idea and on a smaller scale?

Furthermore, what modern early stage companies need are actionable teams of specialists not mere advisors. Thus, the solution which presents itself in a rather simplistic aggregator style model as we shall further discuss based on a pay-per-performance rather than billable hours. 

**Project Scope:** 

  

The project allows for the scope to be an inclusive aggregate model which does the following- 

1- Working with businesses to understand their goals and suggest them a systemic growth plan to go with the same.

2- Along with the suggested growth plan we will supply them with ancillary task force as and when required. 

3- To achieve the same, we have to assemble a talent pool as soon as we are done with assessing the business requirements. 

4- This talent pool would be passively maintained for future projects as well. 

AI and data science shall be the backbone of our operations thus producing more objective results.

But this also means that the team is lacking a lead developer. The pandemic only makes the situation worse, at least in my city where people are all in lockdown state. And so I'm considering hiring a freelance developer for the time being.

That said, I'm still not sure if it would be great idea. There are several questions like:

* Where can I find quality freelance developers?
* What should I pay attention to when interview them?
* How to ensure they stick to our progression?

2 years ago I did hire freelancer once, but that is to UI design a Chrome extension. The guy was not exactly bad but for some reason it is rather difficult to work with him.

21,Try thinking about creating value before figuring out what the solution's gonna be,"After 16+ years of development, I noticed that I evolved in a couple of phases:

* first I was doing simple programming chores
* later I started doing consultancy work.
* in recent years, I started focussing on providing value instead of defaulting to tailored software solutions

As a consultant, you're not only working on developing solutions for your customers, but you are also responsible for finding out what the core problems or challenges are and if the suggested route (if any) is the right path to follow.

You need to think about the challenges and compare the solutions that are applicable to find out what is the best solution for the buck and what will help to support any goals people and/or companies might have regarding the solution you're defining and estimating.

I've come to believe that we can do one even better: instead of diving at the code, or thinking about a possible solution, we need to focus on finding out what value a solution - any solution - might bring along. If we focus on how a solution needs and might bring value to the table, we can then find out if developing a custom software solution is really the best one.

What about putting together some services? Or changing the process? Or using non-code for a simpler solution that brings enough value to get going for the next 2 years? Maybe a specialized other SaaS product is better suited to help the customer out and referring them to it is all it takes to make them happy? 

As a developer, I really dig creating new solutions from scratch, but I truly believe that alternatives might sometimes be the better way to go at a customer's solution.

I think this mindset is also what got me interested in product development, and startups. The lean startup method tries to find out if what you're creating is viable; provides enough value to others so they want to pay you money for it.

So, I really think that focussing on creating value first - whether it is as a developer, entrepreneur or startup founder, is what can differentiate you from the flock.

In [this article](https://medium.com/shipharder/create-value-before-a-solution-6b7db609b02b) I go more in-depth about my mindset and how I've found out that looking for the value and focussing on providing value first, I've made more companies and people happy that I could have by using ""building a tailored software solution"" as my default service.

What is your vision on this? Do we - as tech people, developers, and makers - tend to focus on building software too often? Or could we be of more service by helping people out (even if that means not spinning up another solution for the next customer)?

28,Is anyone interested in creating a new startup solely sourced by Redditors? During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Hey everyone! I have this crazy but potentially worthwhile idea. What if we created a totally crowdsourced company consisting of Reddit users?

The current climate is particularly terrible for finding new work. But what if If we were to pool resources (Marketing, DevOps, Sales, Business Mgmt, etc.) together to create a new company?

Before I begin diving into an explanation I will explain a little about myself. I have a background in digital marketing and website development but also experience in a variety of sectors (FinTech, MarTech, SaaS). I am a Product Development Manager for a Virtual Reality company based out of Atlanta. In 2014, I started my own consulting firm and was fortunate to have the opportunity to work with a number of different startups over the last 6 years.

I have had several ideas for new startups during this time I have kept in my back pocket for a rainy day remote situation. One of these ideas, I have already completed extensive customer discovery for. I know the pain of the customer is there and the solution is quite simple. But I would need help in achieving this goal in all reality. Totally open to pursuing new ideas as well!

I know so many Redditors have experienced being laid off or temporarily let go from their jobs and are sitting at home looking for something to do. So the thought hit me, What if we pooled our resources during this downtime and all worked together for a common goal? Surely our combined industry experience could have this product to market (MVP) in almost no time if we put in the work. The risks are incredibly low for this project besides the overall willingness to help. It's mainly just the investment of time and energy into developing something that has value for others. I am not propositioning this idea for personal gain but with the idea to help our community benefit during this crappy time. And to maybe have something to show for our efforts once things go back to normal.

How cool would it be to say we started a successful company from an internet forum? I'm sure there are others out there who have done the same thing but the climate right now is much different than ever.

**If you have an interest in being a part of this whether you have no startup experience or tons I would love to talk with you. I think it would be so cool to start this idea together and measure our success as we grow. I look forward to seeing the variety of crazy responses I am sure I will get from this post. My only intent is to see how far we can take this idea.**

I'm talking about those welcome email when user signed-up, reminder email to fill extra info, payment received email when user makes the payment etc.

There are some mailchimp 'hacks' which could work for some time like manually trigger a campaign from their V3 API but then there are also hardcore limitations like you can't send the same campaign again to same email even if you unsubscribe and archive that email in mailchimp crm, an email can go through tag based automation only once! etc.

Clearly mailchimp wasn't built for this purpose so they came up with  [https://www.mandrill.com/](https://www.mandrill.com/) . You can buy emails but unused emails get expired at the end of month (wtf business model), and, mandrill also requires you to have a paid account on mailchimp. wtf again!

It differed from Netlify in that it was a CDN down model, i.e. content is made available and cached on-demand from the CDN, where-as Netlify is a build-up model. We thought this would appeal to designers and developers. 

Just before launching, we went to a JAMStack conference and realized the future of the frontend was technologies that were built and compiled on the backend. This was not what we designed our platform to do, and while we considered making a build system, there was no compelling reason why, and no problem to solve; Netlify is a sound system. We aren't sure that people hosting small websites will ever convert to subscribers either (we aren‚Äôt a website builder).

Since then, We see a high number of signups, but for web hosting, despite the fact that we removed all website branding/marketing. The question we are dealing with is: do we want to shut down these use cases forcibly. They cost money in resources, but more importantly, in time; time in customer support; time in bug fixes; time in scaling use cases which I'm not sure will ever develop real value.

We do believe in our pivot, and we‚Äôve seen some good indicators, but sometimes a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. We haven‚Äôt been adding any new web features, but we haven‚Äôt removed any features either.

We know the conventional wisdom is to hard pivot and direct all resources towards your winning vision. In our case, our pivot uses the same technology bed and just builds on it, extends it, and doesn‚Äôt necessarily exclude these users. Maybe its a bit intoxicating to have real users too.",startups,1586281431,RobotRidge,4,1,True,2020-04-07

**Netflixed by Gina Keating**

* History of Netflix
* Published in 2012 (15 years of history)

**Early origins**

Netflix was founded by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in 1997 in Scotts Valley, California.¬†

Before founding Netflix, Hastings and Randolph were at another company called Pure Atria, which is where they met. Hastings was the CEO and Raldoph came on board as the Vice President of Corporate Marketing.¬†

It was here that the two individuals met, which would then spark the initial ideas for Netflix.¬†

In 1997, Pure Atria was to be acquired by Rational Software for an $850 million dollar swap, and during the four months that it took to close the deal, Hastings and Randolph finalized their ideas for Netflix.¬†

On their long commutes from Santa Cruz to Silicon Valley, the two individuals discussed and debated their next idea. 

**Inspired by Amazon. Amazon‚Äôs ability to mail books over mail.**¬†

* Build an e-commerce company:¬†
* Concept of delivering goods via mail
* Amazon delivered books via mail, and he wanted to do the same thing for another consumer good

**Initial idea**

* Idea of mailing VHS tapes for rental (DVDs did not exist)
* Rejected idea because VHS inventory costs would be $65 to $80 per tape, and mailing costs for such bulky inventory would be too high¬†
* Eventually, they decided on DVDs. Randolph founded the company, and Hasting became the first investor, putting in $2m¬†

**Timing is everything**

* DVDs needed to exist¬†
* E-commerce (i.e. Amazon) needed to exist¬†

**Similarities between Netflix and Amazon (Netflix cofounders were inspired by Amazon)**

1. Amazon: largest selection of books; Netflix strived to have largest selection of DVDs
2. Both required fulfillment centers -- warehouses stock the products that are then distributed to consumers via mail. *Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers were optimized for distributing books. Netflix‚Äôs fulfillment centers were optimized for distributing DVDs.*¬†
3. Both required significant investments early because of high startup costs. Needed teams of engineers, servers, and fulfillment centers.¬†
4. Both companies rode the wave of the dot com bubble in the 90s

**Focus on renting DVDs**

* Initially, they sold **and** rented DVDs
* Selling DVDs was actually more profitable than renting DVDs¬†
* However, Hastings knew that renting DVDs, not purchasing DVDs, was the future, so they got rid of selling DVDs and completely tailored Netflix around renting DVDs.¬†
* They did stuff that seems normal now but pretty groundbreaking at the time.¬†  

   * They let users rent as many movies in a month as they would like (up to six movies at a time).¬†
   * They had no due dates or late fees.
   * It was really easy to exchange DVDs because of the queue.¬†

**Comparison to Blockbuster**

* Each movie cost a certain amount
* Due dates and late fees - fighting¬†
* Not particularly easy to find a new movie¬†
* Had to go to the physical store to find what was available, rather than a queue where all your movies were stored¬†

**Founders: Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph**¬†

* Randolph: original founder and CEO¬†
* Hastings: first investor with $2m investment
* As Netflix grew, Hastings became more interested in Netflix and eventually took over as CEO

**Comparison of founders**

* Under Randolph, you could describe Netflix‚Äôs culture as free-flowing and creative.¬†
* Under Hastings, you could describe Netflix‚Äôs culture as more mechanical and mathematical.¬†  

   * And it helped having Hastings as CEO, because the math helped with designing fulfillment centers and creating algorithms to figure out what users wanted.¬†
   * They also built recommendation engines to help deal with inventory shortages.¬†
* Hastings would do whatever it took.¬†  

   * When Netflix IPO‚Äôd in 2001, he cut nearly half of the work force so that they could achieve profitability.¬†
   * He also gradually moved Randolph out of the company, assigning more and more duties to other executives until Randolph had no role, and they agreed that he should resign.¬†

**It almost seems like Randolph doesn‚Äôt get the recognition he deserves.**¬†

* The company‚Äôs origin story discredited Randolph as the person who conceived the idea and who first ran Netflix.¬†
* Hastings originally said that he got the idea for Netflix after having to pay $40 in late fees for returning a movie late.¬†
* Later, Hastings said Netflix was inspired by a math problem about solving for volume and distance for delivery mail.¬†
* The truth, of course, is that they originally wanted to build an Amazon for something, and they just chose DVDs.¬†
* And Randolph was the original CEO.¬†

**Common narrative of Netflix and Blockbusters**

* Netflix came in
* Blockbusters couldn‚Äôt compete
* Declared bankruptcy

**Reality of Blockbusters**¬†

* Blockbusters was late to the online game
* Netflix had better operations and was much more cost-efficient
* **However**: Blockbusters eventually came out with a fairly strong value proposition: the ability for users to both order online and go to physical stores directly to rent and exchange movies¬†
* They had the same value proposition as Netflix: renting movies online, but **also** the ability to satisfy the urge to immediately watch a movie.¬†  

   * Netflix couldn‚Äôt do the latter: it always took one or two days to ship a movie.¬†
* When Blockbusters came out with Total Access, which is what they called their combined online presence and in-store option, Wall Street thought that Blockbusters would win.¬†
* Before Total Access, Blockbusters had already tried to compete with Netflix with online DVD rentals, but the market was in Netflix‚Äôs favor: Netflix had 70% of the market share, and Blockbusters had 30%.¬†
* After Total Access, Blockbusters had 70% and Netflix had 30%.¬†
* Blockbusters also had a large balance sheet with strong cash balances.¬†
* Thus, they could cut prices to a point at which Netflix could not compete.¬†

**So what happened to Blockbusters? The truth is that Blockbusters simply self-destructed.**¬†

* The board featured a famous activist investor named Carl Icahn, worth billions.¬†
* He constantly fought the CEO of Blockbusters, John Antico. As Blockbuster‚Äôs stock kept dropping, Icahn blamed Antioco constantly.¬†

**‚ÄúThe turmoil and uncertainty you have created threatens to destroy the organization, jeopardize our success and couple prove damaging to shareholder value,‚Äù Antioco wrote in a letter to Icahn that he filed with the SEC.**¬†

* Antico actually set Blockbusters up perfectly to compete.¬†  

   * He was the person behind removing late fees and investing heavily in online.¬†
* The clash between Carl Icahn and John Antico led to his removal from the CEO position.¬†

**Antioco is best known for declining an offer, from** [**Reed Hastings**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Hastings)**, to purchase** [**Netflix**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix) **for $50 million in 2000, while CEO of Blockbuster. He also refused a proposal from** [**Netflix**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix) **to run Blockbuster's online presence.**

* In his stead, they put the former CEO of 7-Eleven, Jim Keyes.¬†

**Jim Keyes removed funding from their online presence**

* Saw it as a cash burning proposition
* Doubled down on physical stores and put things like pizzas and merchandise in the stores, thinking that Blockbusters could be a place where people come with their children, rent a movie and grab a pizza.¬†¬†

**Once the financial crisis occurred, they had $350mm of debt with insignificant cash flows, and the banks were not willing to refinance, so Blockbusters had to declare bankruptcy.**¬†

**There are two options in bankruptcy:**¬†

1. Reorganization:¬†  

   1. Debt is too high, so negotiations occur over the debt obligations.¬†
   2. And the company emerges with a new balance sheet.¬†
   3. This is what happens with many companies that file for bankruptcy.¬†
   4. This is what happened to General Motors.¬†
   5. They were able to emerge because they had a sustainable model.¬†
2. Liquidation:¬†  

   1. Not only is debt too high, but the company‚Äôs business model is not sustainable.¬†
   2. This is what they recently decided with Toys R Us.¬†
   3. It didn‚Äôt make sense for Toys R Us to continue running as a business¬†

**Blockbusters bankruptcy**

* Blockbusters liquidated rather than reorganize¬†
* Their business model (moving away from online rental and double downing on physical stores) was broken.¬†
* It was because the Board decided to put Keyes as CEO and remove funding from online rentals.¬†
* I think Blockbusters would still be here today -- even with the 2008 financial crisis -- if Blockbusters did not move away from their online presence.¬†
* Because they were doing an admirable job competing with Netflix.¬†

**‚ÄúOn the surface, Netflix is a massive video store; taking in cash for monthly renting rights and loaning out DVDs to the consumer. Beneath the surface, Netflix is akin to a think tank, creating algorithms to maximize the lon-term value of each customer that it enlists, orchestrating a complex distribution system and findings ways to reduce its cost of service.**¬†

**It is the unseen aspects of Netflix‚Äôs business model, and its long head start, which differentiate it from the competition and may allow Netflix to retain the leading position in the industry for some time. ‚Äú**

**Streaming**

* Book ends with Netflix moving into the streaming space, but it‚Äôs the early days¬†
* They had not yet gone into original content‚Ä¶ a year away from their first original series *House of Cards*
* Original content eventually became a main differentiator for Netflix, as more streaming services entered the market¬†
* But everyone will always admire Netflix for shifting its business model moving from DVDs and streaming in the late 2000s¬†¬†
* Similar to when Netflix shifted from selling DVDs to renting DVDs: unpopular at the time but absolutely necessary",startups,1586282522,vaibhavverma9,0,1,True,2020-04-07

55,How far can I go in developing a business idea before doing a lot paperwork?,"I have an idea for a product in the broad area of table top games. As far as I can find, the idea is unique, and I've applied for a patent (still pending). Overall, my attitude¬†towards this project is that it is an idea I would like to develop for it's own sake, even if it doesn't turn into a business. However, I think there is a reasonable chance that it could catch on, and I would like to be in a position to make some money if it does.

This is a side project, and I don't plan to (or want to) quit my regular career, which this idea is unrelated to (and luckily my employer doesn't have an issue with unrelated side projects). I think it is an interesting challenge to see if I can bootstrap this idea into a small but functional business in my spare time. Does that sound like a completely unrealistic ambition?

I first started this project almost a year ago, and got stalled out after a few months. I made some basic¬†prototypes,¬†but that is as far as I got. I'm returning to it now, and I'm trying to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. It would be more fun to try this in any form, than to remain paralyzed by uncertainty as I have been.
There are two main things that have held me back:
1) worry that people will steal the idea. I do have the pending patent, but not really any resources to enforce it if it is granted. I don't know how free to be with sharing the idea, and this has held me back from figuring out how to get the product produced. The people who could help with manufacturing seem like the exact people who could take the idea and run with it if they wanted to. From a meta view, I think it is very likely that I am being too paranoid. Does anyone have advice on striking a balance between over and under sharing?
2) I understand that it in the long run, registering as an LLC (or something) will be important. However, at this point, I don't know if this idea is worth anything, and I'd like to be able to play and explore more before going through the hassle and expense of formally establishing a business.
My question is, how far can I go doing this informally, without setting myself up for trouble if this does eventually become a business? If I pay for everything out of pocket for now, does that have implications for an LLC that is formed later? What are some activities that should trigger the thought ""this should done done as an LLC and not as a private individual""?",startups,1586296004,GnarwhalShishKabob,3,1,True,2020-04-07

65,I have an idea for a new OS and the hardware running it. I could use advice.,"For background, I have a BBA in Management, teach myself stuff, look for problems to solve, and think of solutions.

For years, I wanted to get some people together to make a new computer OS. This is to bridge the gap between mobile computing and desktop computing. The smartphone can be used in standalone mode or also connected to a human interface device like a laptop. The smartphone when connected to the laptop is like the brain while the laptop is like voluntary body parts interacting with the brain. While most smartphones have the raw computing power needed for ordinary users, they cannot replace the laptop or desktop due to the physical design.

This was inspired by the Motorola Atrix. It's a phone in which the phone can be used as a standalone device with an option to connect it to a laptop dock to make it function as a laptop. The problem was that it was a great concept but the laptop was bad as a product.

The OS and hardware running it will be from the same company. This is to keep things simple for everyone. While Apple appeals to a premium interest, my OS and devices will appeal to a low and mid tier interest. This is to appeal developing and developed markets. Target costing will be a given. It's when a price is set then the product is designed around the price. It's different from doing the design then trimming later.

The apps for the OS will be designed with an adaptive UI. It will ensure the UI makes sense in smartphone, tablet, and desktop mode. Runtime environments will be used to run Android and Windows apps too. Later on, I'd like to make an advanced variant of the OS for advanced desktop and workstation computing. It can run all the apps for the regular variant as well as advanced programs. If worthwhile, hypervisor support may be added.

All devices will use the ARM CPU ISA. This is to keep everything uniform. The devices will use either IPS and/or OLED displays. Interchangeable batteries will be a given. A concise product line up will be used to benefit everyone. Long term support of at least 5-10 years will be a given. No garbage apps will be bundled. App stores and third party apps will be welcome. The low level stuff will be based off the Linux kernel. This is to avoid building from the ground up. I prefer to expand the company instead of selling it.

How do you recommend I go about finding people to work with me on the OS and devices? How should I go about getting prototype made. What advice do you have in general?",startups,1586312183,cpu5555,8,1,True,2020-04-07

82,ANYONE WANT TO BUILD A WEBSITE THAT'LL ACT AS THE SOIL FOR BUSINESSES AND STARTUPS TO GROW?," 

A website/ platform that serves as a global online incubator for businesses and startups of all sizes with a secondary function of crowdfunding the projects. I know there was a lot of buzzwords in that sentence, but hear me out.

A LOT of people want to be entrepreneurs, to run their own online businesses, Amazon stores or youtube channel or sell courses or make products etc. I‚Äôve had my head in the space for a couple years now, went through the whole process of creating a new product and selling on Amazon. I made all my money back plus a little extra, then proceeded to blow all that money trying out dropshipping because I hadn‚Äôt strengthened my marketing game enough. I have lots of ideas for businesses I‚Äôd like to start, from small products to bigger website/platform type services. It can be a bit daunting and requires money, some more than others. A lot of people are in a similar boat I imagine, having just a bit of money to play with, they risk it all on one or two things, and it takes a while to recover before you can have another crack. 

A lot of people that want to build their own business, or be part of a start up, have different skills. Some might be creative, idea producing, some might be technical CEO type material, some might have the technical developer background that can actually build out projects but don‚Äôt have many ideas of their own, some might be good at marketing, etc. 

What if we could build a website/platform that acted as an incubator for ideas that people could attach themselves to for part ownership. 

Example:

John has a great idea for a product, let‚Äôs just say a fidget spinner, but has no idea what to do with it or even if he wants to run with it. He writes his idea down and throws it into the ether, where anyone that‚Äôs part of the community can see the idea. Mary sees it, loves it, and asks to attach to the project because she has experience sourcing from China. They agree she‚Äôll do it for 10% ownership. Kyle sees the momentum, likes the product and offers to build the website for 5% (I‚Äôm literally pulling these numbers out of my ass). John could decide he doesn‚Äôt want to run with the project, just wanted to put the idea out there and someone else can act as ‚ÄòCEO‚Äô of fidget spinner inc and John gets 5% in perpetuity for being the idea generator. If the idea is good but you don‚Äôt wanna commit to it, maybe you can just ‚Äòlike‚Äô it to make it more visible to others. Good or interesting projects would rise to the top, garnering more attention, more attention means more possibility of actuating. 

Maybe the website/platform would automatically own a small part of any business that comes out of it and use that money to pay staff or have small business funds that people could apply for or win. 

I hope I'm getting the idea across, I think you'l know what I'm getting at. Relatively new idea so probably full of holes, but to be built upon not torn down hopefully.",startups,1586340319,FJthe2nd,6,1,True,2020-04-08

Come ask a question if you like!","Hi r/startups, Lora &amp; Alex are inspiring women founders in tech, and we thought you might be interested in joining the discussions! Here's more info on their work:

Lora DiCarlo was founded in 2017, and after spending a decade in the healthcare industry DiCarlo put her obsession with anatomy hard to work. She is the inventor of Os√®, a first of its kind product that holds 9 patents pending in micro-robotic technology and was a CES 2019 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Robotics category. When the award was redacted, she opened the public conversation about gender bias and inclusion in the tech industry and worked with CTA to update their policies for 2020.

Fine is the CEO of Dame Products, which translates the nuances of our sexualities into human-friendly toys for sex. A lifelong student of sexual health, Fine earned her Masters in Clinical Psychology with a concentration in sex therapy from Columbia University.

Realizing that her skills would be best put to use making concrete improvements to people‚Äôs lives, Fine began developing her own vibrators at home and asking friends to give her their feedback. She was gaining startup experience with an organic shampoo company, and decided the time was right to put her passions and her business acumen to use in the world of sex toys.

120,How do you verify email ids of your customers,"Hi Hustlers,

Im having a saas based web application where users can signup using their email and mobile number. I dont make the email verification mandatory in the platform to avoid drop offs. But lately what happened was, I started getting more bounces on the email because its not verified. I was looking for email verification check apis which is costly but could see many people using it.

My question is

1. Should I make email verification mandatory as in, only if the email verification is complete, I should allow users to login?

2. Or should I use a third party email verification services in the backend which saves the users an extra step of verification. But are there any less costly ones? And is there any reason why people use this verification services? They could have gone ahead with email verification by the user itself?

125,Ideas to boost revenue for a skin care diary app (with real numbers),"I have a skin care diary app that allows users to log their daily activity, what skin care products they used, and take dated progress pics. Users can view their entries in an organized calendar, or view isolated albums of their progress pics. They can also share product reviews in an Instagram-like feed.

I've been monetizing in 3 ways:

1. Amazon affiliate links that I add to each review on the product review feed ($5-10 per month)
2. Rewarded video ads that the users must go through each time they create or update their entries (\~$90 per month)
3. $5 monthly subscriptions to remove ads and more upcoming features (because of technical limitations it must be done through the website not the mobile app, so conversion is low and only \~$10 per month so far)

The ads were added recently and I've gotten 3 1 star reviews in the last month because of them, so it's a short term solution but it's also my biggest, easiest, and most consistent revenue source. I do agree that they take away from the user experience since they have to wait 30 seconds each time, but I am burning $160 per month to keep the application running and with ads it allows me to more comfortably keep the application alive while I ponder about other forms of monetization.

I have a very passionate audience who loves spending on skin care and taking care of their skin but I'm not sure how to make more money from the app. I've already sacrificed a lot of engagement and bad reviews from the video ads, but it has moved the needle the most in terms of revenue.

Does anyone have any good ideas for how to monetize? Perhaps B2B? I'm a one man team so ideally it's something I can implement by myself.",startups,1586391138,Iscratchmybutt,13,1,True,2020-04-08

143,I got an offer to be a co-founder. How do I proceed?,"Hi all.

I have a friend who just approached me about a business idea, and asked me to be a technical co-founder. He has little knowledge about how to build stuff hence why he wants me as a co-founder.

The issue now is I have zero knowledge about running a business and the legal issues involved to know what this co-founder relationship should look like.

If I am accepting a job offer from an employer, I know how the employment contract should look like: salary, duration of work, benefits, etc. But with this co-founding offer, I do not know what form it should take.

My main concern is how to ensure I do not get screwed over and I am not exposing myself to any risk.

Basically off the top of my head, what I think I like to know are:

&amp;#x200B;

* I am offering my skills and my time. How do I ensure I do not have any financial liability. For example if the business goes south and there is loan to be paid, that should not be part of my liability
* I am also going to be reducing my income, as I will probably switch to part-time job and the startup idea won't be paying any salary now. How do I quantify all these investment, and in what form would it be paid back? Shares? Future Salary?
* Related to previous question: how does equity work? How do I ensure I have the correct ""share"" of the business and I am not cheated? How do I convert these future equity into actual finances?

I hope this community might be able to help with some of these questions. Also if there are any books or blog-posts that deals with these questions, I will also appreciate a referral.",startups,1586421973,finlaydotweber,8,1,True,2020-04-09
146,How Does One Realistically Grow A Startup If You Don't Live In A Startup Hub/Ecosystem?,"Seriously lol. It seems that if you don't live in an already thriving startup hub/ecosystem, say goodbye to your hopes of building startups. This is because there is a lack of human capital and financial capital. You will not have access to the talent (people with skills, mentors, connections, etc) needed to get the initial product up and running. And I already know what people will suggest. They'll tell me to go to some ""freelance"" website to find people with skills. But the problem with this is that 1.) it's usually only software-centered and 2.) this is simply not what you should be doing when starting a startup. What i'm talking about is COFOUNDERS, not workers. This is because they're willing to take a paycut inexchange for equity and help you build the company together. If you stop paying someone on upwork, goodluck with them carrying about your startup. ON top of that, they usually have loads of projects they're given (so they obviously will be far too busy to single out yours). Why should they care about yours?

A startup I am about to quit is extending the exercise window of their ISO grants past the 90 days termination, to 1 year. My understanding by reading online is that, in order to do this, they need to convert the options from ISO to NSO.

My question is: can they actually convert those options without me having to sign anything? I have in my hands the original grant that lists them as ISO and is signed by both me and the company CFO, and it seems crazy that they can just change terms like that without my approval.

I don‚Äôt particularly value this window extension because, if it comes with the NSO price tag, it would cause me to pay way more taxes when I exercise, since my tax situation is such that exercising ISO wouldn‚Äôt bring me to AMT territory (I basically have large earned income so the AMT never kicks in).

I am then worried that if I exercise today and then I leave, the accounting department will ""surprise"" me next year and emit a W2 that lists the bargain element as compensation income‚Ä¶

172,Some Help Putting Together a Revenue Forecast Spreadsheet,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I am hoping someone can help me, either directly through this sub or by pointing me in the direction of another sub which may be better suited.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a business idea and I have done some validation of the technology as well as the market and am now looking for some investment. I have someone who is interested but they have told me they would like to see a revenue forecast spreadsheet, showing some potential goals and the revenue that could be generated should those goals be achieved.

&amp;#x200B;

In all honesty, financial modelling is not my strong point so this is something I am struggling with; namely how to present the information so I don't look like a complete idiot.

&amp;#x200B;

My business idea I have revolves around making claims for niche compensation through a single platform within a specific industry. I can't really go into much more detail than that at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

We would be making a claim on behalf of our customers and taking a % of that claim value as a fee. There are 4 types of claim that can be made (for this sake, lets refer to as Type A, B, C and D) which each type offering a set level of compensation against the original purchase price. Therefore, if the original purchase price was $10.00 and they can make a claim of type B, they would be entitled to 25% of that $10.00 as compensation.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to create a spreadsheet that allows a user to manipulate the information within the spreadsheet so they can play around and look at figures based on projections. For example;

&amp;#x200B;

If 'X' number of users make a 'Type A' claim at an average value of 'Z', we would generate 'R' in revenue.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this something that someone could potentially help me create?

177,Should I launch now?,"I had plans on launching my newest startup back in mid-March (I'm in the U.S. and it's U.S. only for now). That is pretty much when the stay-at-home orders were announced and certain businesses were told to close, mainly bars &amp; clubs were first. My startup is all about micro-advertising, which main hits retail, bars &amp; clubs, small business, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'll already lose business as bars &amp; clubs were a huge potential revenue vector, which I was banking on has my platform makes since for them the best, next would be small business (but they are somewhat struggling) and my platform may or may not be of interest to big companies; but you never know for sure what might actually catch on.

&amp;#x200B;

My business is basically super-cheap advertising, cheapest around compared to similar service and I have some features not available on ""the big 3"" ad services. I held off of launching as more and more businesses close, but now I'm not sure if that was the right thing to do. Small businesses have definitely cut back on formal advertising services and have pretty much just done Facebook posting on their individual pages, which always have questionable reach. My service is only $40/month, but that may be tight for some for this current situation, but it would have better reach than their Facebook page. I did plan on having a 30 day launch special anyway, so the first month is free, but I somewhat want to do a 2 month free to help out small businesses. 

&amp;#x200B;

However if I feel like if I do 2 months, maybe even the initial one month;  the business may be closed before they even get to a paid month; depending how bad this pandemic gets. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since I obviously did not plan for a pandemic to be happening, and since no one knows how long it will go on for, I have no idea what to do. I do have the funds to keep the servers going until November without any  income but after that I'll have to close up shop.

What was supposed to be a fun long weekend in the French mountains will now be just 4 long, boring days at home. Rather than binge watching Netflix, I thought of making good use of my time by helping startups in these tough times with any projects they might be working on right now, free of charge.

Why? Because I like what I do and am also very interested in seeing what other people are working on these days.

A bit about myself: I‚Äôve been working as a digital marketing professional for around 10 years and have skills in a broad array of services: from social media to more technical aspects like SEO and analytics. More recently I‚Äôve been working in traffic acquisition for a multinational recruitment agency.

Some areas where I can help:
SEO Strategy (on / off-site optimization)
Conversion Rate Optimization
Social (organic and paid)
SEM
E-mail Marketing
Website Analytics (GA / Matomo / others)

Above is just a list of examples of areas where I could be of help, but really anything goes.

Please write in the comments an indication of what your problem / project is and I will contact you to discuss it further and assess if I can be of help.",startups,1586457204,djtrump,3,1,True,2020-04-09

I have a live streaming concert platform I decided to build after all of my tour work got canceled last month. Phase 1 started as a source of entertainment for everyone who is stuck inside, and our concept grew from there. 

My co-founder, and I have been working tirelessly over the past 3 weeks to get everything ready and so far so good until it became time to fund it. We had to put the cart before the horse a few times in this process so we could figure out how much the events would cost and while we got great deals from vendors we have relationships with its still going to cost about 35k to execute the first one.  I think it's important that we launch this concept asap but I am totally lost on how to move it forward now. We are in talks with a couple sponsors but those deals take time and because we are in a crunch to make an impact we realized this isn't our best option. Should I consider a crowdfunding site like [www.patronicity.com/](https://www.patronicity.com/)? They match your goal 1:1.

200,What should we do next?,"Hey! (I posted it on r/entrepreneur as well, sorry if you had to see it again)

My startup actually works in the sector of students' security (So, B2S). We provided hardware and software solutions to schools that made their campuses more secure and accessible. Also, some basic ERP finctions. We had just finished our first pilot run in February and were about to hit the market when the talk around COVID-19 pandemic began. Schools and colleges were shut. It was impossible to sell our products to schools considering it was uncertain as to when the campuses will reopen. 

So, we decided to come up with a virtual classroom experience for the students sitting at home (practically, a video conferencing portal designed for the schools, especially for teachers, who are having a really hard time working with apps like zoom). I know we are late, but it took us time to figure out optimal servers and some front-end problems. We have decided to give every school a different mini-server that will make their experience a lot smoother than other apps. There are features like whiteboard, live chat, screen recording, document upload, no limitation of time, Presenter (helps in presentation of projects/PowerPoint presentation) and a really simple UI. It's a web based service that works absolutely fine on mobile browsers as well. Also, we are also offering 24*7 tech support services. To add to that, our prices are almost at par with other available services (the paid versions of apps like zoom, etc).

The problem is that it's already been almost a week and we have sent almost 500 cold mails and haven't received any reply. Since, it's a completely online based service, we tried to reach out to channel partners in other countries with no success. What are we doing wrong? What other options do we have apart from cold mailing? (We tried cold calling as well. They just gave their email ids and asked us to send a proposal there). There are teachers who are using our free services (we don't offer much in the free tier. It's more like a demo class. The server cost can shoot up anytime with some load) and are really impressed with it. Still, schools are not willing to spend when they can use Zoom for free. I don't know if the schools in my region think that way or if it's a universal thing. Maybe that's why we thought about reaching out to channel partners.  

Would really love to hear your thoughts and advice.

So I have an idea for an app. It's a great idea, and I think right now with the lockdowns across the globe is the best time to launch it.

My idea has the potential to bevome a household name.

This would be my first startup, and therefore I was hoping I could receive some advice from the people of this sub Reddit.

Sadly I have no capital, but I'm willing to take out loans to support this idea. But due to the cost of app development I alone will not be able to raise sufficient funds.

So I'd be looking for an angel investor. Could anybody shed some light on how to go about finding an angel investor. What stage in the business I would need to be at to make this a viable investment. How to make sure I'm not ripped off and my idea isn't stolen. How to vet an investor to ensure they're able to provide more than just capital (i.e. contribute ideas &amp; experience).

And here is an article on the company who has been around for 136 years and have NEVER laid off a single employee.

https://groundswell.org/meet-the-one-company-thats-never-laid-off-an-employee/

If you have been affected to the point of being unable to make it the best thing to do is be completely transparent and speak with the people involved they may have reasonable solutions. 

Find the number you need reduced each month in order to make it through. When you have your number in mind consider doing something a little different:

‚Ä¢if you are the owner or a higher paid employee take a temporary voluntary paycut you can afford to take while not jeopardizing your families needs.

‚Ä¢ divide that number between all of your employees and ask them to voluntarily take staggered unpaid days off throughout the month.

‚Ä¢similar to the last one, shut your offices down for additional days or hours throughout the month.

‚Ä¢take your unused employees and temp hire out to another company at shared labor costs.

‚Ä¢take slow areas of the company and utilize the opportunity to cross train in other areas.

‚Ä¢if you are financially well standing but lack work loan employees out to volunteer organizations.

‚Ä¢if you have multiple offices, implement a work from home or relocate employees to other locations and get rid of the office least financially reasonable.

‚Ä¢perhaps the business owns assets such as unused vehicles, tech, or equipment that be sold or scrapped for some extra money.

These times should be an eye opener to all the economy can take a turn for the worst at anytime unexpectedly. The best thing you can do is to prepare by saving several months worth of expenses or having some sort of disaster plan. While it is much easier said than done the struggle to make this goal a reality will save you and your household when times hit hard.

But all I can find here is fashion manufacturers/printers who offer a lot of value added for that industry, when all i need is someone with a sewer and scissors. 
So I'm looking for your advice. 
How did you source your manufacturing when you were starting and needed really small batches but still wanted your own design selection?
Also I'm no native english speaker so maybe i'm not using the right keywords in my searches. What keywords would you reccomend to make my searches more concise?

I am finishing/graduating from college this month and have a job offer lined up. A small ( &lt; 5 man ) startup that is about \~6-12 months away from revenue. I'm soon about to finalize the position and wondering is it viable to negotiate salary since this is my very first 'real' job. The company has offered me \~65k (Canada) with no real details as I am still waiting on the contracts. I feel that I should negotiate with no expectations but also knowing that you rarely get what you don't ask for. 

I've been in contact with them for 2 months now and feel really good about the company, direction, culture, and team so I do want to work there. I connect with the founders well and they are transparent with everything so asking is not too far out the scope. (I'm also one of their first hires)

283,"3 public resources (2 outbound, 1 inbound) for selling to restaurants, franchises and other SMBs","Hi! Our company sells to restaurants and franchises (not the best time right now, but there's still lots of opportunities). I've talked to a lot of people in the space, and one of the biggest challenges is finding good information about this market, and reaching this audience. You can't just open the phonebook or hop on LinkedIn to find out who owns your local McDonald's or independent. I've seen a few posts about it, so I wanted to share 3 resources we've found over 5 years that work really well:

1. **ReferenceUSA** \- there are TONS of companies selling lead lists. Most of them are basically scraping this (we've cross-referenced). What's great about RefUSA is that it is FREE through most libraries in the US (there is also a Canadian version). You just need a library card. They have contact names, positions, addresses... all the way down to details like the number of employees and credit rating. Only thing you don't get for free is emails, but a rep there told me it's not really worth it in most cases.
2. [Franchise Disclosure Documents through Wisconsin](https://www.wdfi.org/apps/FranchiseEFiling/default.aspx) \- anyone selling franchises in the US or Canada has to issue something called a Franchise Disclosure Document to prospective franchisees. There is a wealth of information in here - from information on processes to the financials of the parent company. They also have to include a list of locations and store information. The info provided varies, but it often includes the name of the franchise company or the individuals on the franchise agreement. We blend the info from this with ReferenceUSA to get as comprehensive as we can. A few states make these publically available - Wisconsin is the best/easiest one we've found.
3. [HARO (Help a Reporter Out)](https://www.helpareporter.com/) (Inbound) - heard of this a while ago, but only just signed up because it had never occured to me that it could be useful for B2B. You get regular daily emails that list out requests from journalists/reporters looking for sources, and so far I've seen lots of ones about the restaurant industry looking for thought leadership. This is more of an opportunity to develop reputation (and occasionally backlinks) than direct selling... but if you're looking for PR, this is a much better way than cold submissions!

We're restaurant focussed, but of course all of the above could be helpful in other SMB contexts as well! 

Also, remember the **Golden Rule of Public Resources**: don't do stupid shit and mess it up for the rest of us. :) Don't run scrapers, try to resell the information, spam blast, that kind of thing.",startups,1586614051,derekwilliamson,11,1,True,2020-04-11

285,Where would one search for investors?,"Hey everyone, a few months ago, I had an idea for an app. I started making sketches, writing down ideas, and looking up resources. Since I am a developer, creating the app was loads of fun and I gained a fair bit of experience. Just today, I got to a point where I can say that I'm very happy with it, and I am thinking about publishing it. Now, the app is somewhat similar to Instagram but it definitely has a twist to it. It's not something that already exists, and I asked some of my friends and they confirmed that it sounds like something that they would definitely use. Now, the app is probably not something that's going to generate millions and billions of dollars, but it's bound to do well. 

Buuut, there's a big problem. The app is ""finished"" per say, but it's definitely not production ready. And to make it production ready.. well.. that would require money, and a fair bit of it. Firstly, I would need to actually buy licenses for the google store and the ios store. Then, I would need a mac to build the app for ios. Then, there's still a fair bit of coding that needs to be done, one of the most concerning part is security. I have no idea how I would make the app secure and safe to use. And there's probably a lot of things that I didn't even think about, since I'm just not experienced well enough for this...

My question is, would something like this even get backed by anyone? Should I even bother? I really like the app and I'm really happy with it, and if nothing else, at least I get to show it off on my CV. Thoughts?",startups,1586615582,randomseller,5,1,True,2020-04-11
287,Considering leaving corporate job for a start up.,"Light background:
I‚Äôve been working for my current employer for 8 years (currently furloughed, 75% likelihood I will be offered my role again in near future) and have been offered a job at a start up I helped develop a relationship with in my current/old role i.e a new client I signed. I‚Äôm in my early 30s and have 2 kids and have worked for one employer (15k employees) post college graduation. The new role is in a similar industry where I have experience and a network. 

The offer:
I‚Äôve been talking with the founder since late summer 2019 however it was all in regards to activating and launching our new relationship. When I got furloughed, March 10, 2020, all 3 of my contacts at this start up contacted me to stay in touch and check in. I‚Äôve since had several conversations with the founder about potentially coming on board to his team. Yesterday, April 10, we had a call when he verbally said he would like me to come be a part of his team. I‚Äôm expecting an official offer letter this next week. 

The start up:
It‚Äôs a company founded by a person who used to be the CEO of a large company in a major industry. They have $1MM now (12 month runway) and expect another round to receive $2.5MM this summer/fall. They‚Äôve been around for around 1 year. 

The questions:
I‚Äôm not very familiar with start ups and have done some basic online research about what to ask during the offer process. I‚Äôm hoping this awesome community can give me some personal insight into what‚Äôs important, key questions and clarifications, and maybe help me understand some of the terminology around shares, vesting, and they like. What are some things you wish you would have asked for when you started working for a start up or understood better now that you are working for one?

302,Do you actually know your ideal client? Tips from a CSO,"Hi everyone,

My name is Jorge, I run a boutique Design Studio in NYC where we do strategy as part of our offerings. I thought I‚Äôd share some of the framework we use with our clients during our strategy sessions on how to uncover their ideal client.

I will assume that at this point you know/have defined your culture, voice, and how this ties to the look and feel of your brand and are at the stage where you‚Äôre either looking for a VC or trying to find your first leads/clients. The framework will apply to all of the above.

The first thing that you want to do is look for a piece of paper and divide it in four quadrants. On that sheet, you should answer the following things:

* Demographics
* What is his/her story?
* What is his/her needs?
* How does your product/service exceed his/her needs?

You can make it as simple or as thorough as you may want it to be. This will depend on where you are in your startup journey. I recommend going as deep as possible here, literally making up even their first/last name. Remember to be purposeful and come up with a few diverse profiles here.

How many ‚Äòuser profiles‚Äô should you build? In my experience the sweet spot is three.

If you‚Äôre struggling to answer the above, a good warm up exercise is to answer the following from a first person perspective of who your ideal client is:

1. **I am**...... *(Adjective + Title)* (‚ÄúOverworked CTO‚Äù)
2. **I struggle with**...*(‚ÄúChallenge they are facing)* (‚ÄúGetting noticed against bigger players in my field‚Äù)
3. **I want**...*(solution)* (‚ÄúAn agency that specializes in startups/underdogs‚Äù)
4. **Thus, I need**...*(benefit)* (‚ÄúTo move the needle, be recognized as innovative‚Äù)
5. **Or I risk**...*(what happens if I fail?)* (‚Äúadditional opportunities, being let go‚Äú)

Doing this in first person is important as it will allow you to put yourself in the shoes of your ideal client and be empathetic towards their needs. I recommend doing anything from 2-4 profiles like this.

Questions?

I hope you find this helpful, answering these questions will help you craft a more impactful message that is specifically catered to your target audience, and will, hopefully, separate you from your competition!

Best,

Jorge

359,Startups strategies for challenging big companies,"Hello knowledgeable Redditors 

I find WhatsApp vs Telegram to be an important case study when it comes to startups challenging the dominant companies in the industries.
No I'm not saying telegram is a startup.
This is a Goliath vs David situation.

In this case. You're at home on a sunny Sunday afternoon when an idea strikes you. You're using an app then you realise the people who made this app are a joke, I can certainly do better. A lot of important features are left out this app is just bare bones skeleton. You decide to take action and build something that will challenge the current app since the app is just meh! Mediocre to say the least.
Mind you the current product is backed by a big company.

You get started. Do some research, build mvp, validation is a success‚úî‚úî.
You're excited .
You're technical so you make designs and start building, somewhere along the journey you get yourself a cofounder. 
You get users. Get traction things start moving.

Wasn't that the case with telegram? Or any messaging app that came after WhatsApp?

The question I have is people seem to have stuck with WhatsApp regardless of the fact that Telegram is light years ahead of WhatsApp in terms of features

Is it wrong to base your startup on an app that improves the current app available? 
If this was a nice and guaranteed way to get into the market, shouldn't Telegram be seriously challenging WhatsApp?

If you understand the WhatsApp-Telegram situation, help me understand why Telegram isn't making WhatsApp seated on their high throne to Tremble considering telegram is better",startups,1586767338,davemwas,4,1,True,2020-04-13

393,Strategies to reduce risk of large chargebacks,"If a startups' core business is a service broker on behalf of others whom are providing some service, and they are receiving money by credit card and then paying the other party by ACH, what strategies can you use to reduce risk?  Is there a good resource or guide on this aspect?  For purposes of this conversation assume a model 
 similar to how AirBNB works.   $200-300 bookings collected via CC, then when the service is paid by startup after the booking service is provided. The actual service provider gets their payment to their bank directly, minus some sort of booking commission fee that is transparent to the consumer; or, instead an explicit service fee is added and explicitly paid by the consumer. 


A potential concern for fraud for example would be someone creating a totally fake service provider and the validation done doesn't catch that, churning money out of a stolen credit card, then getting paid to that fake provider, and then the card gets charged back 3 weeks after. Additionally--how do you scale worldwide in this scenario... or do you not?  

A few things that come to mind would be evaluating the risk profile of the consumer/provider either manually or w/ something like Maxmind; perhaps holding back money for payment to the provider on some schedule until both parties are considered not new. Or not getting involved as a party to the transaction, but having the payments go one party to the other, and the provider pays a larger monthly membership fee instead. I'm specifically trying to not do that though for competitive reasons. And in terms of chargeback risk/fraud (/legal risk?), are there pros/cons to taking a service commission out transparently when paying the service provider vs giving the provider the full amount but charging the consumer a service fee?",startups,1586808581,danekan,1,1,True,2020-04-13

An interesting thing I picked up on was a decision making process that chefs go through by eyeballing some numbers and just going by their gut feeling. I thought the decisions could be made faster and more accurately if the users had an app that showed how their choices would affect their costs in real time. I even put together a small demo, and I think the recovery after the pandemic would be a good opportunity for restaurants to save costs by removing some inefficiencies.

The problems is I have no contacts in the business so I have no way of knowing what users actually need, and whether they would even be open to using insights from an app. Normally that would be the end of it, because I have zero experience in marketing to that sector. But I'm wondering if there's a way for me to get in contact with people in the restaurant industry and see if they'd be interested.

404,Discussion with a Cofounder,"Hello, I recently had a discussion that came up with my co-founder and I want to ask your point of view: 

We are creating a social network for people to communicate with each other, like Twitter (of course with a different value) and our revenue model is In App Purchases, like coins to exchange with badges to give to users posts or comments (like Reddit or TikTok).  Later we are going to add advertising (but when we reach more users).

What he says is that he wants, in addition to those badges in app purchases, add other customizable things for users for purchase such as the color of the border of his profile photo, a background photo in his profile, an avatar next to the photo and more things that affect the UI and users can customize their application the way they want.  

I told him that it is a horrible idea because it seems like a game (like plato) very playful, not a social network (if not, every social network would have done it). I am completely against that thought, i hate that users can change all that because it is not clear what we communicate as a social network. I told him we should communicate who we are, minimalism design and don‚Äôt let users customize stuff. 

His explanation is: we want to earn money and if we offer more ways and options for users to purchase and is easy to create it, we don‚Äôt lose anything and we earn more money, like if we offer more ways is simpler to earn money.

What I think is that there is no social network doing that. They might have a reason. Offering too many ways to customize your social network confuse your users. If not, Reddit would have done it to monetize better.

What do you think? Am I right? Is a good way to earn money offering too many in app purchases options to customize the design on a Social Network?

John has been amazing at his work but from the looks of it John is not considering letting go  of b-school ticket. to put things into perspective this is one of the most prestigious B-schools in the world. John promises to work part time from B-school but given the intensity of B-school, I doubt he's going to be able to especially from a coding capacity.

My conclusion: It's unlikely that Google, FB, MSFT, Amazon will be challenged by any startup unless there are strong regulatory changes.  We cannot beat them at their game now, they are too big. The only way these might be beaten is if the game changes in itself i.e. there is a fundamental change in the way we consume technology. This might be the case with AR and VR but even in these cases these companies have an inherent advantage. So maybe the only way for startups is to build on technologies given by these companies i.e. we need to complement them rather than compete with them.

E.g. Look at two startups which are trying to directly compete with the big guns: Snapchat vs FB and Slack v MSFT Teams. Both these startups have weak long term prospects against their big daddy rivals IMHO. Even if they continue to survive, their profit margins will keep taking a hit while competing with giants who can afford to burn cash. Here is where Peter Thiel's ""Competition is for losers"" idealogy comes into play as well.

I am currently a senior in high school and created a medical device last summer - at the University of Houston under a post-doctorate mentor - that aids in the wound healing process. It became a finalist at a couple national/international high school business competitions and I know it‚Äôs something I really want to pursue given the increasing global burn care/wound care market size, and the many stakeholders involved.

So, I filed for a provisional patent as the sole owner of this device, this January on the medical device. My mentor wasn‚Äôt interested and was leaving to work at NASA.

My initial prototypes of this device did not come out as how imagined but I filed the provisional patent based on what I expected it would look like. 

Now, I will be heading to the University of Texas at Austin and I am unsure what my next steps should be. I tried contacting a few professors there to be my mentor/adviser, through email, but they told me they cannot work on an outside filed patent or were not interested. I finally joined the research group of a biomaterials professor and eventually plan on asking him how to improve my device when I get there.

My question is, if I do happen to improve my device at the University Of Texas, will the university try and claim ip or rights on my device if I use their resources to help build my device.

Another option is to try contacting a local angel network, to try and raise the money and find connections through them to locate a lab + researchers to improve the device, but I know most will either not be interested or take a large chunk of the company. University of Texas does have a few entrepreneurship/startup clubs to help launch startups but not sure how much it will help as I basically need to improve my medical device first.

88,Planning and Managing Layoffs,"
Nobody ever wants to do layoffs. Laying your employees off is one of the hardest things you do as a leader. But remember, however badly you feel about it, your issues are small compared to those of the impacted employees. For them, the layoff may cause serious financial and psychological distress. It will also force them into a wrenching emotional disconnect from their friends and colleagues. You think you have it tough, but they have it far tougher. Your duty as a leader is to do everything in your power to give them as many resources as you can and offer them the most dignified exit possible. This will take careful thought and planning, and it may be the most important planning you ever do as CEO.

Since most people have no idea how to do layoffs well, nor have a resource to help them, this document now exists. I‚Äôve unfortunately had to do layoffs, and helped others through them, so I want to share some best practices and things to think through as you do a layoff. I‚Äôm starting from the point that you‚Äôve already done everything possible to avoid a layoff and you‚Äôve gone through the difficult process of figuring out what roles to eliminate. (I say what roles, not who, because that‚Äôs how you should be thinking about this. It‚Äôs not a person by person decision, it‚Äôs a role by role decision.)

Also note: I am not a lawyer. I am not your HR person. And as I point out below, you absolutely must consult experienced counsel and HR professionals in this process.

Properly executing a layoff is important in a few dimensions: legally, culturally, and ethically. How you handle a layoff, how you communicate it to the people impacted, and how you manage and lead throughout the process really matters. It matters to the people who are now leaving the business, and it matters to the team that is part of the go-forward plan, and neither group will forget how people were treated.
Points to consider as you plan your layoffs:

Consider a furlough (leave of absence): Depending on your company size, cash management requirements, and benefit plan policies, you may be able to put employees on furlough for three to six to 12 months where their salary (and potentially vesting) stops, but benefits continue. This gives the company time to stabilize finances and re-open the furloughed role, and/or allow the impacted employee ample time to find a new job while dramatically reducing the costs to the employer. If you can do this, it‚Äôs a huge benefit to the impacted employee. The employee is afforded the optics of still being employed while they conduct a search for a new role (which helps in their search), and they get continued benefits coverage, which is often critical. It also emphasizes the point that this is really a cost-savings decision to save the company and not a performance-related decision. 
Think about health benefits 

Time it right: If coverage in your employee health benefits plan ends on the last day of the month (most, but not all, do), and you are executing your layoff in the last ‚Öì of the month, consider designating the last day of employment for all impacted employees to be the first day of the next month. That gives every impacted employee 30 days to figure out COBRA or get added to a partner‚Äôs health plan. Leaving employees in the lurch at the end of the month or without any continuing benefits coverage is totally avoidable, so avoid it.

Treat your employees like adults: I‚Äôve heard many CEOs who want to offer their employees two weeks of severance but offer three months of coverage for health benefits. This well-intentioned (albeit paternalistic) thinking is wrong. In addition to creating logistical problems, you have no idea what your employees‚Äô actual life situations are. Maybe they can get on a spouse‚Äôs benefits plan, maybe they are young enough to rejoin their parents‚Äô, maybe they will return to a home country with alternative healthcare options. Just pay them the cash and let them decide how to manage their own affairs.

Think about severance: Be consistent in your severance policy. Often, severance amounts will be based on tenure (much preferable to basing it on seniority). A common model employers will consider is paying two to four weeks for every year of service, with a maximum of four or eight weeks in total. Many companies won‚Äôt be able to afford to part with that much cash (especially all at once), and two or four weeks may be all they can do. Offering less than two weeks severance pay is outside the norm, as is offering more than eight weeks.
Timing

Do it once: If you‚Äôve never conducted a layoff, your first instinct is to lay off as few people as possible. But anyone who has ever done layoffs as a company-saving measure will tell you they wish they had cut deeper. If you‚Äôre going to take on the massive emotional and cultural impact of letting people go, be sure to create sufficient savings so you and the remaining team have the cash required to get through to the other side of the crisis and survive. Doing multiple rounds of layoffs demoralizes your team and erodes any trust and confidence they have in you.

Are you notifying them or are they leaving that day: For less experienced leaders managing through this, I recommend the date of notification be the last day the employee has access to most workplace resources including offices, laptop, email, and badge. That doesn‚Äôt mean they need to leave the payroll system that day (for instance, to continue benefits into the next month), but they are effectively on leave from that moment forward and no longer have to do work and can focus on finding a new job. While it can sound jarring to say ‚Äúand today is your last day,‚Äù it‚Äôs generally better for people because it makes it clear that there is a new normal and it starts right now. It is reasonable to allow employees in certain roles or levels of seniority to continue to have email access for professional or business reasons. Obviously different roles come with different needs. For example, an hourly worker in a call center may not need access to anything from the point of notification forward whereas a business development executive who needs to carefully transition some key relationships to a new owner may justify continued access.

Still, there‚Äôs no perfect answer on this one ‚Äî some employers use a longer notification period to let impacted employees begin their search for a new job while they are still technically employed, essentially trading severance time for notification period time. Figure out what is right for your company based on the kinds of roles being impacted, your culture, the maturity of your workforce, your level of comfort with having impacted employees continue to access systems, and legal requirements.

Dealing with company property while remote: Because of COVID-19, nearly all workers are now working from home, so you will be unable to collect their company property (laptop, badge, etc.). Be clear that this is still company property and will need to be returned at a future date ‚Äî either a laptop box with a return sticker will be mailed to them or equipment can be dropped off once health-related shelter concerns are lifted. Make it clear if they are or are not allowed to use their laptop after the notification period. For many employees, this may be their only computer and would be useful in conducting their job search. Remember that with every decision you make in this process you need to err on the side of doing whatever you can to help the impacted employee. That likely means letting them still use their laptop.

Depending on your IT security policies, you may even decide to allow employees to keep their laptop as a part of their severance, but do that only after you recognize, understand, and accept the financial, security, and intellectual property risks that approach creates for your company.
Leverage your board, corporate counsel, and comms team

Ensure all layoff decisions and processes are approved by your board of directors with counsel present. Strong corporate governance isn‚Äôt just a checkbox item ‚Äî the feedback and legal protections you gain by getting your plan formally approved is critical for an executive. If done truly terribly, an executive could be opening themself up to various liabilities or even criminal actions. 

Corporate counsel or external employment law is an absolute. You will need to be current and up to speed on many aspects of the law around who and how you lay people off inclusive of:

    Individuals on visas
    Adverse impact reporting
    Cal &amp; Federal WARN
    Releases in exchange for severance pay 

Throughout this planning process, confidentiality is an absolute must. However, toward the end of your planning process, be sure to include your Communications lead. They can help you draft and prepare all your internal messaging for all employees, as well as create a plan for any possible press inquiries. 
Points to consider as you do layoffs: 
Company communication is critical

You as the CEO need to own the messaging around this. Employees joined your company because of your vision and you. And now you‚Äôve failed them. You now need to be the one to own the communication around layoffs and take responsibility for what is happening. And ultimately, it will be your decisions that determine if employees are treated with dignity and compassion. This is where trust and confidence is built or broken.

As soon as you begin notifications, word of layoffs will travel quickly, so try to complete every conversation as quickly as you can. To the extent possible, avoid one-to-many notifications and try to notify people as privately as possible. It does not matter how many notifications you need to do, it is possible to do them all individually. If your organization is large, you will have to leverage your leadership team to take on some of the notification responsibilities. That means the burden is on you to train and educate your leaders so they do it in a way that exudes deep empathy and consideration for the impacted employees.

As soon as notifications are complete, you will have to communicate to everyone in your company so they hear the news from you directly, and also so they know notifications are indeed complete (so they don‚Äôt have to worry about their own status). Assume whatever email you send will be read by those leaving the business and potentially the general public. This should be a previously prepared email explaining the change, the reason for the change, and deep appreciation for the outgoing employees‚Äô contributions. Remember, at this point, you are now communicating with the go-forward team. In coordination with IT or HR you will need to have a way to quickly message everyone not impacted in the workforce reduction. In the email you should also announce an all-hands for later that day (ideally) or early the following day so they know they will have an interactive opportunity to hear from you. Waiting too long to assemble the team is a grave mistake. They need to hear from you, and quickly.

Depending on the size of your organization, you may want to communicate out ahead of the layoff action to all employees. For more on this, listen to this podcast with my colleagues Shannon Schlitz, Operating Partner for our People Practices group, and Alex Rampell, General Partner and repeat founder. For smaller organizations, this is not necessary.
How to actually tell someone they are being laid off

Note: This advice is geared specifically at doing layoffs remotely, but it is applicable to in-person layoffs as well. 

Schedule with common sense: The communication with the impacted employee should include at least two company representatives, ideally one of whom is a trained HR professional, to avoid he-said/she-said scenarios and to maximize legal protections. For more experienced managers, this isn‚Äôt strictly necessary.

Be cognizant that sending a calendar invite to an employee for a 20-minute discussion with a manager and HR representative is not very subtle, so don‚Äôt do that. You can always create a second invitation for the HR person so they aren‚Äôt on the original 1:1 invite. If you are doing these in an office, make sure events are configured to be ‚Äúprivate‚Äù so the room calendar for the event doesn‚Äôt show all the meetings being scheduled in it.

Don‚Äôt reuse your Zoom or WebEx ‚Äúpersonal meeting room‚Äù in back-to-back meetings. Create a new meeting for each conversation.

Be prepared: It‚Äôs very smart to have a script prepared in front of you. You can piece it together from what I outline below. It‚Äôs not uncommon to get flustered or nervous delivering this news. Rehearse with a colleague if you need to. And trust me, you need to rehearse this. And do not stray far from your script. Do not let a thoughtful and compassionate plan be ruined with bad delivery. 

Logistically, have your camera turned on, make sure recording is turned off, and make sure you are in a quiet place without distractions. Do not be driving, etc. Have your electronic document package with all layoff and severance related information ready to go so you can send it while on the call or right after the call.

Less is more: Since these will be video calls, try to avoid the small talk with whomever is joining the call. You just get to the point, ‚ÄúI have some news to share with you. The leadership team and I have had to make some difficult decisions in order to try and save our business, and as a part of that, we are eliminating your role at the company and you are being laid off.‚Äù I‚Äôve always found you literally need to deliver the news twice (in this case, saying ‚Äúeliminating your role‚Äù and ‚Äúyou are being laid off‚Äù) because many recipients quickly enter a state of shock or dismay.

And then you just wait. The person needs a moment to process. It might be an awkward silence. That‚Äôs okay. They may be upset. They may be embarrassed. They may be angry. It may be all of those things at once. But let them process. Then, they will ask you a question. ‚ÄúWhat does this mean for me?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhen do I stop being paid?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow many other people are being affected?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat if I work harder?‚Äù ‚ÄúCan I take a pay cut? I need this job.‚Äù 

Here‚Äôs how to handle different kinds of questions and reactions:

    If the question is about logistics (When do I stop being paid? What does this mean?) then you can say, ‚ÄúI know this is a lot. I‚Äôm going to be sending you a document that outlines specifically what we will be doing as a part of your exit package and providing additional information and resources for you as soon as we get off the line.‚Äù Depending on how many of these you have to do, you can talk them through it, but I would suggest not offering to walk through it as they will have a TON of questions. Make sure your paperwork is in order so you can quickly deliver them all the information, and access to all employee resources you can make available.
    If the question is on another aspect (How many people impacted? What if I work harder? Can I take a pay cut?) or is just venting, the right thing to do is listen and acknowledge them. It is not appropriate to share whom else was impacted on the team. Stick to the script, repeat the talking points, and listen. This is about them and keep the conversation focused on them. It‚Äôs important to remember: You aren‚Äôt there to have your mind changed, you aren‚Äôt creating wiggle room or giving false hope. You are there to deliver information as clearly, and compassionately, as possible. It may be tempting to say ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt realize how bad this was going to be, let me see what I can do,‚Äù but that‚Äôs false hope. It‚Äôs terrible and weak. It is much better to deliver the news as it is, and privately work behind the scenes if you truly feel an error has been made and needs adjusting.
    If the employee becomes overly emotional and is having difficulty composing him or herself, it is okay to end the conversation and tell the employee that you recognize it is an incredibly distressing and major change for them. Be clear you will be happy to continue the conversation once they have had time to process.

What can you do? What can you say?

    Be a leader. This is where true leadership shows up. Demonstrate empathy, be a listener, but stand behind the company‚Äôs decisions. If you are doing the notification, but you didn‚Äôt make the decision, you cannot say you are ‚Äújust the messenger.‚Äù It‚Äôs extraordinarily pathetic to question the decision to lay someone off as you are laying someone off. If you truly felt that way, you should have opted out of being the person doing the notification.
    You can certainly say ‚ÄúI know this news is hard to hear. It‚Äôs normal to have questions that come to you later that aren‚Äôt top of mind right now, and I want to make sure you reach out to me or our HR team when you have them. We want to be available to you as you have questions and do whatever we can to help you.‚Äù
    You can say ‚ÄúI know this is a lot to take in, but you will get through this.‚Äù
    If appropriate, make clear that you or someone at the company would be willing to be a reference for them when they are considering job opportunities. 
    Make it clear what the transition is for them, literally. ‚ÄúAs of today, you are no longer required to come to work or do work, and your access to email and company resources will be restricted. If we miss anything, please recognize you have a responsibility to not use company resources. We will be keeping you on payroll until the 1st of the month so that your health benefits continue for the following month‚Äù (or whatever your policy is).
        A note on IT logistics: Often employees will ask ‚ÄúWhat about all the personal items I have on my system? How can I get this information back?‚Äù While they shouldn‚Äôt have personal data on their corporate machine, the reality is almost everyone does. I always err on the side of assuming good intentions and allowing people time to get their files in order and back them up somewhere. Since these notifications are all being done over video and employees have their laptops with them, logistically you likely have less control over this anyway.
    Understand what Employee Assistance Programs (EAP) are available in your benefits plan and make sure you have the documents, links, and resources ready to send to an employee so they can take advantage of all resources that they may not be aware of. This is critical, even if it‚Äôs the last bullet point. Your benefits plan, and the government, have many programs available. Know what they are and be organized in how you share them. You must do every possible thing to make this less terrible for the impacted employees.

How do you get an F? 

    Do not make this about you. Do not, at any time, tell them how hard it is for you to give them this news, or how agonizing it was to make this plan. You still have a job, they do not. This is not hard for you, it‚Äôs just unpleasant. Not having a job is hard. I remember once hearing a manager say ‚Äúthis has been such a hard day for me‚Äù to people in an all-hands after he conducted a layoff and I will never forget the person who said it and I will never work with that person again. Do not be this person. Even thinking about this person now just makes me angry.
    Do not make jokes or be lighthearted. This is not a lighthearted thing. Even if you‚Äôre nervous and trying to diffuse the tension. Even if it‚Äôs an awkward silence. Just be quiet and listen. Leave room for the person to process the news.
    Do not tell them they will be fine. Do not tell them they will find a better job. You don‚Äôt know if that is true. Do not be prescriptive about their future. Do not tell them you will help them find a job (you may offer to try and help, but you cannot guarantee that you will find one for them, and I find the no-guarantee offer to help comes out sounding very weak).
    Do not blame others. Do not blame the virus. Do not blame the market. Do not blame your board or investors. Just own it.
    Do not ask them ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù because that phrasing is about making you feel better for delivering terrible news and has nothing to do with you supporting the employee. You can definitely ask if there‚Äôs something they need.
        If you are genuinely concerned for their safety and wellbeing, or believe they are a danger to themselves or others, you need to tell them that‚Äôs what you are observing, and then you need to be prepared to call someone close to them (and tell them you are doing that) and/or emergency services.
    You get an F if you fail to have legal or HR review those impacted prior to notification to make sure you aren‚Äôt disproportionately impacting specific protected groups (race, gender, etc.). This is especially important in larger organizations where the creation of the list of who is being impacted may have been delegated further down the organization.
    You get an F if you don‚Äôt lay out your day and have a prepared communications plan (built and reviewed with HR and Comms) such that throughout the day you are largely going through a pre-planned, scripted, and practiced set of motions. Without that, you will screw it up, and then you‚Äôll get an F.

There‚Äôs no way around this: If you have to do a layoff, it‚Äôs going to be one of the worst days of your career. But not as bad as it will be for your impacted employees. You hired someone who worked hard and due to no fault of their own is now losing their job, at a time when losing a job is terrible. However, if you conduct your layoffs with both compassion and clarity, you will ease the burden on your employees and help them begin the process of transitioning to their next role while building trust and confidence with the team that remains.

One last thing based on some comments from draft readers (HR pros, CEOs, etc.): What about pay cuts instead of, or as a part of, layoffs? This sounds good in theory and often helps the team in the short-term feel better about sharing the pain collectively, but it has side effects. First, your financial analysis will tell you it does very little to reduce your cash burn unless your company has hundreds of people (then it is worth considering, as it may save some roles from being impacted). If you only do 10% or 20% pay cuts, it doesn‚Äôt materially impact the overall weighted cost of a full-time employee. Second, it risks hurting morale significantly. Within two or three pay periods, when people start to see their reduced paycheck, they will often start to look elsewhere for work (assuming they can, otherwise they‚Äôll just be annoyed). That said, for founders, executives, the broader leadership team, and people making over a certain amount of money, pay cuts can be an important symbolic gesture. In those cases, I‚Äôm supportive of pay cuts ‚Äî but the gesture is generally symbolic ‚Äî it‚Äôs not really saving meaningful amounts of money. For individual contributors, or people paid less than a certain amount, it‚Äôs not worth doing pay cuts and I would absolutely exclude those individuals if you plan on enacting any pay reductions.

I definitely would like to create an LLC, but haven't confirmed the best or affordable way to accomplish this while living abroad. 

There are many posts on Reddit that recommend using a Registered Agent Service such as Harvard Business Services‚Äîwhich also helps with the formation of a business in the state of the Delaware. Or obtaining an e-residence in a country such as Estonia. I have read pros and cons for both which include: requiring to file as a foreign entity, being over charged when you can file certain things independently at lower rates, or in the case of e-residency ‚Äì experiencing buggy systems or being subject to high withdrawal/distribution fees.

My permanent residential and mailing address is in Pennsylvania; my mother's address. When creating this company I would be required to have a business address, virtual mailbox (I have found some options), and be able to open a business bank account. Does anyone (preferably American), have experience doing this while living outside the US?

Additional comments:  
The online businesses I'm interested in are online courses, digital freelance work, etc. that can be done remotely.

184,Getting into a StartUp -Advice?,"Hello Everyone,

Long time lurker here... got myself into some ""trouble"" and I cannot see a clear answer anywhere, therefore I come before you for some advice.

2 weeks ago I got approached by a very good friend of mine, lets call him Joe. He started to explain how in the last 4 months he partnered with some other friends of ours (i was a roomie with one of them, will call him Dan, but have to mention that Joe set us up as we were both looking for apartments about 4 years ago, I moved out 1 year ago). Joe recently quit his job to go into Sales Coaching and Business Consulting and so he has taken this Startup of his other friends as a ""Pro Bono"" case as to manage them and get them on a better line.

Background for the StartUp:
They released 2 collections of tshirts, hoodies which were 30 pieces/model. They were designed by them, bought the material, painted them ""manually"" and went to a professional tailorshop and worked together with the tailors to make the products.
They pretty much sold everything, with little stock remaining, but they did not analyze anything, where they sold it to, how they did that or anything. They just sold it and thats it.

Now:
The startup consists of two guys as the main founders, a new designer which came along recently and I suppose Joe(he said that the only gain for the moment is experience, as he has no equity,yet).

When he approached me after he told me what they are currently doing which is defining the business plan from here forward. He asked me if I could help him a little with some numbers regarding the marketing budgetting, CPM's, CPA's and stuff like that which would help him define better the business plan and surpass this point. After giving an insight from some of my running campaign, I pointed out that he couldnt move forward without a previous case that generated numbers in the past. We then hung up and he called me the next day asking if I wanted to come along as their digital marketer/website dev.

My principal responsbilites would be:
-managing campaigns
-analyzing
-interpreting data
-build the website&amp;maintanance (this would be together with the main founders, Dan and the other one)
-social media marketing
-atl marketing if budget allows

My secondary responsabilities would be:
-have a say in the Marketing Strategy
-give my insights in the Content Creation(no, i do not make the graphics,videos)

For this they said that I will receive 2% equity and when the firm can pay salaries,an average market salary for this job, as well as them, if the firm can pay more everyone will receive more(in their plan this should happen in 1 year). 

The explanation of this equity that they gave me is that they split the business in multiple parts and the part that I'm doing is equal to 1.5%. Also they said that because I will be working as a part timer and I'm not dedicating fully(i have a job atm, but agreed to go there when they will be able to pay a salary). But I cannot see how the split was done because after I would be influenced by it and would have subjective arguments as to why my responsabilties have to get more procents.

Is that right what they are offering? I have no idea, it feels so little I dont even know if they are joking or are serious. I kind of want to join the team, I want to expand my experience and have this project in my portofolio, but I think I'm getting the short stick, or am I?

That way, we were able to introduce the rates as low as *$25-$30/hour.* These are the rates for senior developers, with at least 3+ years experience, not juniors with no proven work record.

Anyone who claims the offer before the 1st of July will get 60 days of reduced prices for all new hires. That's going to save you about $5000 just on one full-time dev, and thousands more compared to Toptal's prices.

189,What are the rules/restrictions regarding what can/can't be included in the Articles of Association?,"These questions refer to the rules in the UK. I'm asking this from a purely hypothetical standpoint - I simply want to understand whether there are limitations surrounding the Articles of Association or whether you can set out whichever rules you wish for your company?

My questions are;

1. I have read that a special resolution is often required when issuing new shares.  
Can the Articles of Association give a specific person/position (e.g. the Managing Director) the power to issue shares without agreement from the shareholders? Or is the special resolution a legal requirement?  

2. If so, can you restrict this power (e.g. the MD can issue a maximum of X number of shares in a time period of Y months)? And, in this case, can you have a secondary set of rules to allow for the issuing of further shares if required (e.g. an ordinary resolution/special resolution/unanimous agreement is then required)?  

3. Finally, can the Articles of Association name a specific person/people as directors/managing director and state that they are safe in their role (obviously with certain exceptions outlined - e.g. resignation, death, no longer being of sound mind etc.)? Or do shareholders always have the power to remove a director?",startups,1585855325,Climate987,0,1,True,2020-04-02

This virus went from an issue on the other side of the world, to chaos globally in less than 4 months. 

While researchers are hard at work creating vaccines, cures, and solutions to eradicate the virus, the rest of the world is either learning to cope in quarantine, taking care of the sick, figuring out ways to flatten the curve, or help make life more bearable through innovation. 

**The Global Covid-19 Innovation Challenge** was launched to *find, feature, and fund* these people trying to help, and now startup applications are streaming in from around the globe.

From nurse re-education for covid-19 treatment and deployment software, to food-delivery, to virtual clinic triaging, we are witnessing entrepreneurs/startups around the world step up to help. 

The challenge will start interviewing the people behind these initiatives starting next week and hopefully connecting them to governments, corporations, health care providers, investors and more.

194,Whitelabel customer wants me to match their current supplier and develop a cheaper product,"So I have recently acquired a white label deal to an offshore brand. They have been getting similar products to mine made from my country. Compared to their current supplier mine are superior in quality, packaging, and how it's made. This is their feedback.

Since we started the initial order he's been negotiating with me about my wholesale prices. Please note that his initial order is just 100 units. He wants me to move the other production to my facility as well. I am a home business owner. Everything is done by me. 

I've tried numerous times to explain to the client that why my products are expensive. Which his response is that he's trying to run a business and wants to make profit. Another thing he keeps brining up is that ""we haver to figure out a way to bring your cost down"" ""let's try to brings stuff down from alibaba""  
I've been doing this for over five years, from RnD to finding suppliers. Spent plenty of time doing this in the past. I've been there done that. He's just being a greedy little bitch. His business matters to me, so I've been keeping it professional and polite. 

Recently that I told him that the new products he wants could be done for a lower pricing but, there has to be a larger order (the supplier wants me to place a larger order). I could RnD for a different way of making things. But, he wants me to match his current supplier. I wanted to know if I am doing things right here.

First time entrepreneur in my early 20s here.. 
I‚Äôll be entering a market that is small in my region now but is expected to grow quite fast based on the trajectory of the same market in different regions. It is a consumer business so feedback from the market is very important to me. Since my target customers happen to be very similar to people in my social circle, I have been talking about the product here and there in my social circle. Most people are quite enthusiastic about it and ask for samples etc. but there are about 20% of them who don‚Äôt look too keen on it/ straight up discourage it. Now I know I can‚Äôt make everyone happy so I‚Äôm content with an 80/20 split for now. 

Now some of the feedback is genuine and I‚Äôm very grateful for that but I can‚Äôt help but notice that with some people it has a tone pointing towards looking down on me of making fun of me, waiting for me to fail. Some of that is with regards to the business itself saying that it‚Äôll never work or some comes from them thinking I‚Äôm not capable of doing something like this. 

How do I separate the constructive from the rest? I don‚Äôt want to miss out on any bit of criticism that might actually help me by disregarding it because of personal resentment that I might feel or what I may perceive as negativity from the other person. 
Once I have done that, how do I stop myself from focusing on the purely negative feedback? 


I‚Äôm taking the leap and starting this because I genuinely love and enjoy the process that surrounds this specific product and after much reflection, research and planning, I do believe that I can achieve what I‚Äôm planning.

216,15 Alternative Sites to Submit Your Product that are NOT Product Hunt,"This is a post based on frustration and desperation to get my product in front of as many people as I could. I wanted to look at what‚Äôs beyond Product Hunt and surprisingly, there are lots.¬†

Original: [https://productbar.substack.com/p/15-sites-like-product-hunt](https://productbar.substack.com/p/15-sites-like-product-hunt)

1. Slant ([https://www.slant.co/](https://www.slant.co/))

This one has a complicated submission process, but they claim to have 2.8 million users, so I‚Äôd crawl on sand if I get to list here. Decent design plus they have a blog that drives traffic. Win-Win.

2. Softpedia ([https://www.softpedia.com/](https://www.softpedia.com/))

If you are selling any software for free this is the place to be. Apart from PH and Hacker News, they seem to have the largest data base of free shit across platforms. Plus updated very regularly, this is an easy kill.¬†

3. FileHippo ([https://filehippo.com/](https://filehippo.com/))

A better designed version of Softpedia, I didn‚Äôt realise till I started this research that this is a product listing site. It also has a blog that gets significant traffic, so there is an added incentive for you to list here.¬†

4. Software Informer ([https://software.informer.com/](https://software.informer.com/))

If Softpedia and FileHippo reluctantly had a kid, this would be it. Ugly on the outside and inside, this website has a blog that has surprisingly decent traffic. Free shit will sell here because while I was there I didn‚Äôt see any paid products. Worth a try.

5. StackShare ([https://stackshare.io/](https://stackshare.io/))

They seem to have a social component to their site much like Product Hunt. The design is mediocre but again, user generated content will drive heavy traffic here. They work on developer tool recommendations, so if you are in that space then this might be your golden or at the very least bronze ticket. They were featured on Tech Crunch and when was the last time those guys were wrong?

6. Startup Tracker ([https://startuptracker.io/](https://startuptracker.io/))

With one of the most unoriginal logos I‚Äôve ever seen, this site seems to have a diverse database of startups. The ones you‚Äôll probably not see in bigger databases. Their filter system is actually decent.¬†

7. Museum of Modern Betas ([http://momb.socio-kybernetics.net/](http://momb.socio-kybernetics.net/))

This site seems to have the most ‚Äúbeta‚Äù level products there is. Has a surprisingly decent SEO score and seems like it is giving out do-follow links. You‚Äôll have to email the founder to be featured since he still lives in the 2000s.

8. Indie Hackers ([IndieHackers.com](http://indiehackers.com/))

Hands down my favourite platform. I‚Äôve got little in terms of direct business but the community is one of the most helpful ones I‚Äôve found online. Think of it as a lighter version of Hacker news but with people who don‚Äôt automatically assume they know every thing about everything.¬†

9. StartupLift ([https://startuplift.com/](https://startuplift.com/))

This one feels like something my late grandfather would like. The design is 2005 but some of the startups seem to be from 2018. So try your luck with this one. I think the links here are do-follow links, so you might get a SEO push.¬†

10. Killer Startups ([https://www.killerstartups.com/](https://www.killerstartups.com/))

This one is between a blog and a startup featuring website. Based on the ones featured, this must be pretty easy to get into. So give a shot and if it sticks then good and if not, then who gives a shit.

11. Startup Buffer ([https://startupbuffer.com/](https://startupbuffer.com/))

Again, this is a list that I have not personally submitted to, so take the results with a pinch of salt. Their list doesn‚Äôt seem to be updated regularly but there is an upside to it. If you manage to get your product on it, then it stays there for a little while longer. I‚Äôm a glass half-full kind of a guy.

12. Launching Next ([https://www.launchingnext.com/](https://www.launchingnext.com/))

I discovered them during my research for this post, they seem to be active and I am basing this on the products they have listed which are the top ones from PH and Betalist from the past few days. No harm in submitting.

13. Hacker News( [https://news.ycombinator.com/](https://news.ycombinator.com/) )

Mostly focussed on CS and startups, this one is run by Paul Graham. Ending up on the first page of this site can land you some good traction initially. Probably next only to Product Hunt itself.¬†

14. Betalist ([Betalist.com](http://betalist.com/))

Probably the most famous after Product Hunt and Hacker news, Betalist is a go-to website for product submission. I‚Äôm personally also subscribed to their email newsletter and they haven‚Äôt spammed me yet.

15. BetaPage ([BetaPage.co](http://betapage.co/))

Claims to have about 30,000 newsletter subscribers and fairly active. The process is similar to that of Betalist.

I was looking at some card linked apps and was womdering how they work, more specifically, their business model.

I was looking at Dosh for example where you just link you card and it gives you cash backs anytime you buy at a partner.

So i was wondering, i get the business model is taking a fee on the transaction and then giving a part of it as cash back but, do they take a fee on every transaction made at that store if the card is linked ?  Because the app does not require to redeem coupons or something, it just tracks your spending and gives you money for it.

Tech start up lacking the founder‚Äôs confidence, lack funding so assumes it will be simplest revenue generator. It‚Äôs more a perspective of getting funding rather and revise through advertising is simpler way to provide projections for income, rather than use case issues.

I was hoping to start a thread where people could share their learnings about finding product-market fit. Currently, I am going through the start-up school lectures from Ycombinator.

I'll give an example: I work a lot with open-source and am using various matrics on Google Analytics to track which parts of our codebases that people make use of so that we can really focus on one or two verticals. The one thing that I found by looking at the incoming social traffic was that the majority of users came from enthusiasts rather than industry professionals. We released a training program, added a fee, and released it out into the world in a classic MVP style. 

It seems like we have hit a fit on account of already hitting our capacity to handle new students.

303,Want to pitch a niche version of an existing website to its founder/CEO. Is this realistic?,"Hi all! Total startup newbie here. I have a business idea that is structurally very similar to an existing digital service. I‚Äôve used the existing website for a few weeks and absolutely love the model. ‚ÄúWebsite A‚Äù is 2 years old and from what I understand the team is pretty small and the CEO seems personally invested in the service he offers. They have about 20,000 users currently.

Website A provides a service to a very broad market, and I'd like to tailor it to serve a specific community. I‚Äôd eventually like to add additional features, but even a carbon copy of Website A dedicated to this group will be a huge plus for both user experience and drawing in a new audience. It wouldn't be effective as an add-on to Website A, it needs to be its own thing.

I don‚Äôt have the skills or resources to build the service from the ground up, so I‚Äôm thinking of reaching out to the CEO of Website A and pitching my idea. Essentially I‚Äôd like to use his site‚Äôs code but I‚Äôm willing to do ALL other work to develop, promote, and maintain the site. I‚Äôm planning to offer him a % of the profit in return. From a business perspective, is this something many CEOs/startups would consider?

\------------------------------

Here‚Äôs what I can offer him initially:

\-Marketing and pulling in clients for the new site. The targeted community is my professional field, so I‚Äôm very immersed in the community, have credibility, and have connections. I‚Äôm willing to do all of this marketing and outreach myself.

\-Full responsibility for site‚Äôs design and non-functional content. I‚Äôve got a great name in mind, too.

\-Expert insight into the targeted field ‚Äì I know what users would want and need. It‚Äôs a product I‚Äôd use and I think there‚Äôd be decent demand for it, but it‚Äôs definitely a specialized field.

\-A quick launch. This product is especially useful in the current quarantine situation and with his approval, I‚Äôd be able to get it up and running quickly. I‚Äôve got bold long-term ideas, but with minor tweaks to his site I could have a basic version up and running in a week.

Plan: Create a visual prototype of the site‚Äôs design. Reach out to the CEO and ask if he‚Äôs open to this sort of thing. If he is, schedule a virtual meeting to do a full pitch and present my prototype. Offer a % of profit and possibly marketing/ties to his website on mine. 

Is this crazy or stupid? Any possible pitfalls I should be wary of to avoid being screwed over? If he‚Äôs interested, where do I go from here legally?

**TLDR;** I have a business idea that‚Äôs a niche version of an existing website. I‚Äôd like to pitch the idea to the original site‚Äôs CEO and offer him a % of my profit with no extra work on his end ‚Äì in exchange, I'd need to use his website‚Äôs structure/code.

322,Email Marketing when shifting to a SaaS conversion-based sales model,"I'm trying to figure out a way to handle a significant increase in our email requirements without blowing up our costs.

I run the revenue side for our startup - we build, host and support a number of private networks. Our clients are very large enterprise associations, and they give access to our platforms to all of their members as a free benefit. The associations pay us, users get in free.

We are now starting to sell in-platform upgrades and adjacent products in a store inside the platforms. Revenue shared to the associations for their member purchases.

The percentage of users who will buy upgrades and products is very low, but increasing the delta even a small bit would lead to massive uplift in profitability.

We currently just use a really rubbish email server for outbound notifications about platform activity. We aren't doing ANY active marketing mails to try to increase conversions. None.

We are currently adopting Fresh Desk for user support and tracking. Cost doesn‚Äôt really increase as the user base expands.

We want to use Fresh Sales and Fresh Marketer for marketing mails. Since our costs there will expand as the contacts list grows, we will only add users into the contacts list if they take some action that indicates they could be converted, like they already visited the store for in-platform upgrades, or they added something to their cart without checking out.

The vast majority of the user base will never visit the store, since the core functionality of the platform is freely available to them. So we will use Fresh Marketer and Fresh Sales to construct conversion journeys for users who have shown interest in the upgrade products, and for handling ongoing communication about the products with them.¬†Maybe only 10% of the whole user base will make it into this contacts list.

But we have will still have a **lot** of non-marketing, non-conversion emails to send as well. Tons. Notifications about in-platform activity, triggers to login based on other activity, etc.

Obviously we can‚Äôt treat all of that as if it‚Äôs conversion-emailing, because it‚Äôs not marketing, and it won‚Äôt lead directly to any sales.

So I need some kind of outbound email traffic handling system, one that is cheap on a per email basis. Maybe mailgun or sendgrid? We will still need some very basic journeys mapped there, like an onboarding journey etc. But not proper marketing stuff.

Am I way off base here? From the start of the company, we've been selling very heavily-customized one off products for large enterprise clients, with no opportunity to make revenues from the actually users. So this world of user-paid upgrades is new to me! And we have now hit on a way of delivering an off-the-shelf version of some of our custom solutions, that could be really interesting to some of the individual association members. I don't want to screw this up!

326,Startup ideas from analyzing what people are searching during COVID lockdown,"Hey, I'm Mike and I own a startup that tracks rising trends.

I thought to measure what the impact caused by the global economic downturn is by tracking online searches.

We analyzed what people in the US searched online in the past month and how their interest shifted week by week.

If people are searching for these things, it means there's demand and that there's a market opportunity you might want to pursue.

Here is what we found.

People went from searching for keywords related to protection (*sanitizers*, *anti-viral mask*s, *immunity boosters*, etc) to searching keywords related to essentials (yes, *toilet paper* was searched a lot).

Then, they begin searching for DIY ways to make them (for example, keywords like *DIY masks*, *how to make shampoo at home* were trending).

Later on, with the quarantine, people started to be at home. We found that they were searching for ways to work better (everything related to *remote working*, or *smart working*) and ways to entertain themselves and their kids (for example, *board games*, *at-home workouts*, etc).

Now, they are also searching for ways to stay in touch with their families (for example, keywords like *Zoom* or *Skype* are trending).

They are now also searching for medical devices that are portable and that they can use at home to monitor their health situation (for example, *oxymeters*).

I hope this is interesting!  
If you want to learn more keywords that are trending upward, I can link to the in-depth case study we published.

Disclaimer: I'm not suggesting that people should be unethical and sell anti-viral masks or other medical devices if they don't have the necessary expertise. What I'm suggesting is that they can, though, rent out gym equipment, for example, because there's an increasing demand now.",startups,1586104096,mikerubini,3,2,True,2020-04-05

358,Being offered a different job position in the startup - What job is that?,"I'm currently the lead designer in the startup that I've been in since the very beginning, we've been in operation since January 2019. In fact, I was the first hire of the company(not cofounder) and end up being in charge with a lot of things apart from design, HR , admin, general project managing. The CFO that I've been buddy-buddy with approached me and asked if I wanna keep doing something like that but in the subsidiaries that we're going to open in other countries. 

&amp;#x200B;

He described it as :

&amp;#x200B;

1. Spend a few months in the potential country opening the office.
2. Understanding the rules of regulations of the country and whether if our business model is a viable or not and what needs to be changed to fit in.
3. Hiring people. 
4. Setting up everything for our customer service and logistics(including procuring vehicles and testing out the planned route for the city).
5. Then move on to the next country. We have 5-6 countries in mind. 
6. He told me since I was there from the very beginning, I know how to set up and run the office with the way our company is used to, wants me to ""implement the culture we currently have in the other branches"".
7. He also told me it's going to be very tough.

&amp;#x200B;

It sounds...really enticing. I've always wanted to work and experience other countries and this seems like a perfect opportunity for me. Anyway, this was a few weeks ago and I've already told him I'm interested but my job title hasn't officially changed yet cause the plan isn't starting until end of this year and plus there's a few design stuff that I need to finish up.

&amp;#x200B;

And if you're wondering, I've completely lost interest in design, I find myself wanting to do everything else other than design. It turns out I enjoy doing project management and I've expressed this to the CTO before. (CEO is aware of it too). And the potential pay is very good.

So here's my question, what job position is that? Cause after the meeting with the C-level execs they can't quite agree on what to call me either and asked me to come up with a list then they'll argue about it until they all agree on a title.

The one I suggested before :

* Global project manager
* Strategic planning officer
* Branch expansion officer

Tried applying into an accelerator. Unfortunately, only made it to semis. We fell off. The idea was great(well maybe to me), but most of the judges‚Äô concerns were on the team. Our team had the technical background but not the background in the industry we wanted to get into (which was sports).

Judges said that our team lacked the experience in sports industry that‚Äôs why they turned us down.

That said, was wondering if being in the industry you want to penetrate in, is a requisite for creating a great/big/multimillion startup? 

Also,  if anyone else had experience entering accelerators ‚Äî could you please give me advise. When a startup doesn‚Äôt get accepted into an accelerator, does that mean that the startup is terrible and judges are just sugar coating it? Should I just throw in the towel?

408,The quantum computing revolution. What do you think of the potential of quantum computing in the coming years and its potential use in different business and industries?,"I am a college senior majoring in computer science with a minor in physics ( particularly quantum mechanics is my interest). As an avid enthusiast of the field and a future entrepreneur who is looking to launch a quantum computing related start-up, I wanted to ask other entrepreneurs and business leaders about their thoughts on the potential of quantum computing and how you think the field might help make the world a better place? 


The dot com bubble in the late 1990s was unprecendented and a major shift in the world as entire businesses and industries shifted towards the Internet. The fact is that many of these were not fully aware of the potential of the Internet but were insightful of the fact that in the near future the Internet would create unparalleled resources. Eventually, everyone set out to reap benefits off the new technology while many also invest in frankly any Internet company which had a prefix like .com or .org among others. 

Quantum computing is a very different technology but has immense potential to transform the world just like the tech boon but in a different manner. Although we don't have quantum computers today but great amounts of progress is being made in the field each day. Google's claim of quantum supremacy is just one example. In 2019 Google claimed to have performed a mathematical calculation in a span of just under 3 minutes using their 56 qubit quantum computer that would have taken over 10000 years for any classical super computer to perform. Given that Google's computer was actually specifically designed to solve that particular problem, many researchers argue that we still haven't reached the point of quantum supremacy. 

But, all in all, the power of computing is exponentially raised when you use a quantum computer. Theoretically, an 80 qubit quantum computer has the ability to store more information than all the atoms present in the universe. Some of this stuff may sound like science fiction but the reality is that the day is not very far when the world switches to quantum computers from classical computers.

We have a great idea, the MVP is nearly complete, and it looks like we'll be closing our seed round very soon - within the next month or so. Which means we are looking to get the company incorporated and started within the next month.


I am currently employed full time elsewhere and am looking at co-founding this company; which means I'll be going full time in the near term. The other co-founders are ready to make the jump as soon as possible, which I'd also like to do.


However, my full time employer is getting ready to pay out bonuses. If I leave before these are paid out, I'm going to miss out on a decently sized bonus - that I've earned over the past year - that I could use to keep my salary relatively low.


There seems to be some concern surrounding IP issues if I remain with my current employer, and continue to moonlight on this project. For what it's worth, I think this is a general concern and not something that appears to be an issue in practice (my employer knows I work on side projects, and hasn't had an issue in the past. Additionally this project is very different from my day job).


My question revolves mostly about how to structure equity in the company, such that I receive common stock as a founder, but am able to stick around at my current employer long enough to get my bonus. The idea was thrown around about letting me 1099 for about a month, giving me an RSA (which as I understand it _becomes_ common stock?) and then coming on full time after my bonus is distributed.


I just want to ensure that:

1. I receive common stock.
1. I receive stock in such a way that it minimizes my tax burden (83b election?)
1. I can stick around long enough at my current employer to receive my bonus.",startups,1586199537,Mumpsimus,11,3,True,2020-04-06

415,A Startup Society OG Redditors,"Hello all,

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

the subbreddit is reddit.com/r/theredditnation

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure
   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy (for now I will be the ‚Äúking‚Äù)
      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building
      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services
      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port
      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing
      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island
      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location
   1. Set up the island as a luxury city
      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island
      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven
      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island
      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure
   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself
   * 500,000
* The Port
   * 200,000 to build
      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry
      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings
   * 1,000,000
      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services
   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation
   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification
   * 50,000
* Food Supply
   * We will purchase MRE‚Äôs and other preserved food products for the island
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island
   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)
   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include
      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.
   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale
      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax
   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation
      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this

The problem is, we need to prove it, right?

Because companies usually do not trust ""just a bunch of freelancers"", we then started a company (software house as you may call it) as advised by a lot of people around. However, there is this space where we are now, where our potential customers do not yet trust us (they feel like we are new, our portfolio is small, we are just a bunch of younglings, etc.), and a group of people who are in need of a small websites ask us to make them one for just like few hundreds dollars in two weeks. We did manage to build our company profile website which people think has good design, cool, etc. etc. but we think it is not enough to prove our capabilities.

I first started building apps that solve my own problems. (Time management, Organization, etc). Unfortunately, most of them barely got passed 100 installs and I realized that making consumers pay for anything is extremely challenging (especially on Android).

Then I was browsing some other businesses on IndieHackers trying to get some ideas and I came across one that was popular in Europe.  They built software that targeted care facilities. So I immediately did research and was excited when I found out the potential revenue and the fact that there's hardly any competition in the U.S. I spent a week drafting stuff, but kinda stopped when I realized that I have absolutely no connection to care facilities. Like I just can't walk in and start pitching to them. I don't even have connections to validate if this is a legitimate problem. Also, do I actually care about solving this problem?

22,How to validate your product,"Due to the fast pace of the start-up world and the risks inevitably associated with ventures, it is absolutely necessary to validate emerging ideas, products, and avoidable innovations in advance in order not to fall victim to the deceptive entrepreneurial euphoria that often withholds the facts from young founders and, if necessary, prevents them from success. Of course, it makes sense to put a certain amount of emotion into every venture of life and not just to rationally deal with circumstances, however, especially with financial or time-intensive decisions and projects, it should be weighed up beforehand to what extent the venture can work. The term Product-Market-Fit describes the degree to which a product satisfies a strong demand in a market and is thus acquired by the end customer. To achieve Product-Market-Fit there are a number of strategies and techniques that can be applied to validate a product. In this article we will explain some effective mechanisms that can be used to effectively validate products and ideas at a low investment level.

Ideas are not rigid but are accompanied by a constantly changing process that shapes the idea and constantly responds to the market situation, customer feedback and other external circumstances. To be able to iterate, however, a starting point is required, which ideally starts with clearly defined assumptions:  


**1. define assumptions**

Since you usually do not know your target group perfectly yet, but you can make a sketch of them, you should start with assumptions. A persona in which you break down the characteristics of an example customer and get a more precise picture is helpful for this (you can download an example persona here: [https://go.aws/2HfRQzv](https://go.aws/2HfRQzv)). You should ask yourself what the concrete needs of your target group are and how you should address them in order to present your solution attractively. An assumption could look like this:

**- Foodbloggers have a low reach and interact with few like-minded people. So it would make sense to create a platform for foodbloggers to network with each other.**

This assumption is not yet validated, but it helps us to approach our target group in a targeted way.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. talk to your target group**

Once an assumption and especially a persona has been defined, it is possible to speak effectively to the target group and to hear their opinion on the problem defined in the assumption. However, the interview should be kept rather open, so that the interviewee does not already have the words in his mouth and tries to push in one direction. It makes sense to start the interview with a basic description of the activity (from the interviewee's side!) and thus already find possible problems. If no problems arise, it is possible to steer the conversation in a thematic direction. An interview guide should of course be prepared in advance. Each interview should be documented in detail so that important information is not lost later. If the previously defined assumptions have not been confirmed in any way, it is already now sensible to possibly reassess or at least change the assumptions.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. formulate a problem solution for your customer**

The addition ""for your customer"" is crucial here, as very many founders do not get out of their position and thus dazzle themselves with false assumptions. For this reason, we created a persona beforehand and already conducted the first interviews. As soon as the avoidable problem solution is defined, a smaller landing page, a Google survey or simply a mailchimp newsletter can be set up.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. distribute your survey/registration page/newsletter**

This is the first time a paid approach comes into play where the validation page is distributed to the target group via online marketing. We will not explain here how online marketing works exactly, but it is important to choose the right network or advertising outlet for your target group and to optimize your campaigns well. Once you have reached a critical mass of registrations, you can assume that the idea is at least of interest to a certain target group. However, it is important to get in touch with the target group again and study their needs and behaviour. This is the only way to build up a product close to the customer and product market fit is one step closer.

**Conclusion:** In general, product validation is much more complex than explained in this article. However, the techniques mentioned are a very good starting point to take the first steps in the right direction and to already work on the customer. If you had to summarize product validations in one sentence you could say ""ask your customer"", because he knows best what problems he has, he just won't be able to communicate them directly.",startups,1585058380,DeployInnovation,4,1,True,2020-03-24

29,Copywriter here: Let me help you with what I know you don't have the patience for!,"Hey all!

I'm a new copywriter here looking to pivot over to the startup niche (currently from automotive!), and while I've noticed plenty of good copy around, I'm sure you would all love some reassurance, guidance, and just general steering in the right direction.

So, that's why I'm here. Many new startups can't afford the hefty price tag of $75, $95, $125/ hour some copywriters charge, so let me offer you help, *for free.*

That's right! Simple case of you scratch my back I scratch yours. I need to build a portfolio in a landscape that I don't necessarily have a whole of lot of experience in yet. You lot need good copy. So let's help each other out.

Two mistakes companies make right out the gate:

1. Getting to the point of their WWHWW. (Who, what, how, when &amp; where). Customers won't stick around if it takes too long to get to whatever point you're trying to make/ sell. Be direct.
2. Being boring! If I want to go to Wikipedia for information on something, I'll go there! Wikipedia isn't there to sell me on something! Don't just inform - sell.

So, what's my proposition? I need 2 companies who want copy written or rewritten for either their website or marketing materials. Your choice. I need companies who are willing to try this copy out for an extended period, to see how well it performs.  If this seems like something you may interested in, please PM so we can discuss further. In the thread below, please feel free to post any landing pages, websites, etc. for me to review if you'd like advice at this time but don't necessarily feel you need copy done!

34,Guidance for First Time Startup Employee - Equity and Comp Fiasco!,"Please don't bash me - I already feel like an idiot for landing in this situation. I got bought into the company's vision, the product, and the CEO. You can't say anything worse to me than what I am already saying to myself but I really need help and guidance badly.

Read on and be amazed by my absolute foolishness - and be glad you are not an idiot like me. And if you have any guidance - from telling me a lawyer that can help with this international mess.

Here's my scenario.

* I am a US citizen who worked for a UK Startup from Jan 2017 to December 2018 (2 years). The company also has a Delaware incorporated business.
* The founder offered by 2% Equity (2966 standard ordinary shares of 142,391) and asked me to take a pay cut for the first two years. I decided to take the offer - as my partner was willing to support me for the first two years.
* The first year was fine. He was paying me as a **contractor - I would send an invoice for the days worked and he would pay me mostly on time** (he said paying me as a contractor was easier since I was a US employee and the company was based out of UK).
* The only problem was - e**very time I would ask him (every other month or so) about sending me the proper equity paperwork and contract - he would tell me things have been crazy and he would get back. I did have all of this in writing via an email though so I was not too worried**. The guy genuinely seemed stressed and I was naive enough to trust.
* This is when the trouble started. He asked if he could defer the already negotiated low amount for a couple of months as he was having trouble getting some funds released from Syndicate Room. I agreed reluctantly but at least we had our first couple clients and with the Series, A funding from a VC seemed to be coming in a few months. Figured I can help. He asked the same with another salesperson - but before all this mess happened - they parted ways (badly - both the CEO and the Sales Person's fault).
* Other than that, there were a few flags that I dismissed - like him lying on the board meetings about the clients, lying about the version of the product and/or capabilities to clients. The main data architect and engineer (the brains/CTO of the company leaving) and the engineers - who were based in Poland - started showing frustration about how the current version was not completed/tested when he would force them to work on the next version, etc.
* Fast forward to October of the year, and in a presentation to the future VC - he lied to the VC about the number of contracts signed and the version that we were on as well as about the CTO being full time with us. Long and short, November of 2019 the VC backs out - after they had finished done due diligence and the paperwork was getting signed the next morning. The VC learnt about this by chance - but obviously didn't take any legal action - except, backing out.
* At this point, I haven't been paid since March and there is $123K in the total amount that he owes me. I am almost getting uncomfortable with the lies that were told to the VC - the way he is managing the tech team and the delay in product development.
* We decide to terminate my employment - he agreed that due to all my patience - the equity becomes vested immediately (again have it in email) and he will just do a back payment of $2000/month until they get funding and then he will payback the rest. (again all of this over email).
* Now in 2020, he has finally got a VC to do Series A. I have only gotten 26K of the total amount due and he still has not sent me (me asking every time and him saying - he is delayed and will send the equity paperwork eventually).
* He sends me an email with a word document saying he will give me 2,966 Standard Ordinary Shares (the word document does not mention how much liquidity has happened in the past year - as he raised some more funds). Details that the total amount due is only $65K (and not $97K). The document states that if I sign this, I will release the company from ""any/all obligations, except the $64K in payment and I forfeit any legal claim and right of action for compensation and forever discharge the company, its officers and employees from all and any liability in respect thereof.""
* When I protest the incorrect amount and the fact that the document does not mention any percentage of total equity - his email simply states ""take it or leave it"". But he will not update the amount and/or even update the equity amount.

If you have suffered through reading all of this, my question is,

1. What are my legal options here? I have all of this in email and his confirmation on both equity and total amount due.
2. How do you even begin to find a lawyer who can help with this UK-US mess?
3. I know the VC that is leading the Series A - do I/should I inform them that I am taking legal action? I also know one of the board members and investors - but he is definitely loyal to the CEO from day one.
4. Anything I can do - should I figure out a way to reach out to other investors?
5. Last but not the least, should I just sign this and take the $65K and forget about the rest.",startups,1585068368,StopDrifting,9,1,True,2020-03-24

79,How do you open a store,"Hi everyone, I am not sure if I am posting in the correct sub, I saw a lot of people trying to get investor in this sub but I am just trying to save money and open a little store, let me know if this is no the correct sub here!

I know that this is a pretty generic question, but I will fill in the details later. First, the type of store I would like to open is a yarn store, where I can sell yarns or some crafty stuff, and maybe I can teach people how to crochet or knit. If it runs well, I may hire a part time to help running the place with me.

I finished university and currently working in the related field, in which my major has nothing to do with business or finance. However, I don't mind taking courses to enrich my knowledge for business, I just need to know what kind of course I will need. 

I am mentally prepared that I might need years or so to achieve this, and I don't mind, I just need to know how much I will need because I am really bad at numbers. Location-wise, I live in Canada and I don't want to open it at downtown, I tend to go to some neighborhood friendly area. 

For now, the cost I can imagine is:

* Rent
* Products (yarns, or other crafting materials)
* Decoration (which, I don't mind helping with some, but I think it is better to leave it to the professional)
* Utilities (electric, air-conditioning, internet)
* Staff (if it runs well)
* Extra (computer, or cashier, or some other stuffs that I miss)

I just want to have an idea on how much I should save up for minimum or recommended. I know there is a lot of unexpected things when you are doing business so you will need to save up more than you spend, but frankly I just want to know more about it!

Let me share another corona time story.¬†

Last three months I was working on an app for tracking relationships with friends and family.¬†

It‚Äôs called Harmony. Here you add people you interact with, and then mutually share your feelings with each person on a regular basis, and thus monitor how your relationship is developing.¬†

So, we had a marketing strategy on how to promote it‚Ä¶ But, apparently, it‚Äôs no longer relevant (you too noticed all those weird brand messages like ‚Äúa perfect picnic tool!‚Äù, right? Picnic, haha.)

Simultaneously, we‚Äôve been testing the app with my wife. And yesterday it helped us to prevent conflict (isolation drives us crazy, you know) ‚Äî no matter that we both viewed it as more as a work project in the first place.

Thus, I discovered new value in it, relevant for our today‚Äôs reality.

I have a lot of visions for what this forest space would be like ‚Äì it would be a beautiful, tranquil place you want to stay awhile. It would be a place for reflecting on the past and reconnecting with the present and with nature. There would be regular events to keep the space alive.
I am even imagining planting QR codes at the base of each memorial tree ‚Äì when you scan them, these codes would pull up a live forum where friends and relatives of that person can post memories and photos, giving you an insight into who they were. It's the best way for someone coming to the end of their life to complete the circle of life and leave a sustainable legacy, and its a new way for all of us who remain to stay connected to those we have lost.
If you think this is a great concept, please join the movement! All you have to do is sign this petition: https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/relive-the-sustainable-death-care-solution

111,Am I missing obvious use cases in microlearning?,"My background is instructional design and learning management systems (LMSs), mostly in medical and government use. Corporate training departments usually focus on large, planned training needs when allocating resources. Last year I began working on a concept for a microlearning platform that could be used around an organization to fill in the gaps that traditional training courses miss. Mostly this seems to be things that arise out of continuous improvement methodologies (Six Sigma, TQM, Kaizen, 1MM, etc.). Something that could be done at the manager level without involving IT or training departments, and that doesn‚Äôt need to be sold at the highest levels of a corporation.

In December I built a static version of the site to collect feedback from friends in the industry. Over the past 3 months I developed an MVP of the product which is pretty much ready for use.

It allows anyone to create, share, and learn with microlearning regardless of their background. It is built to be a grassroots tool, and can work side-by-side with an LMS instead of competing with it.

I anticipate the pricing model will be free, with premium services offered to generate revenue and add value. I have some extra services identified but will wait for more feedback before building them.

What I am wondering as I get ready to pull the switch is if I am missing any obvious use cases outside regular corporations. For instance, it can be used to pull together YouTube videos into a learning course that can also have assessment questions and survey questions inserted where needed. That seems like it might be a useful application for the technology outside a corporation.

I moved to Mexico to start a business in January. Lately I've began to start questioning if I messed up with the company name and URL - kratomex.

134,Startup Marketing Advice: How to Use Your Blog to Find More Customers," 

Hey everyone,

As we sit at home and wait for our businesses to recuperate, now is the perfect time to plan out your business‚Äôs next moves. A lot of you might be producing content to promote your product/service. But are you effectively creating the content that will draw in customers?

I‚Äôm talking about your website. Does your website create the content that your customers will find when they are looking for the service you provide on Google? Most of the time, I‚Äôve found that businesses create blog posts just to create blog posts.

There‚Äôs no end goal in mind and most businesses don‚Äôt realize that the content they create can be utilized to draw in more customers. 

**Why Creating Content is So Important for Your Business**

There are several ways that you can acquire customers for your business. You can go the traditional sales route and call potential clients while following a script. Or you can build an inbound channel that passively brings in leads every month.

That‚Äôs why creating content is so important. Building an inbound channel that passively brings in leads requires content. Lots of high-quality, customer-targeted content. 

When your customers have questions that need to be answered and you answer them, not only are you now seen as an authority figure, but you‚Äôve also proven that you can serve them, giving them an incentive to buy your product or use your service. 

**How to Know What Questions Your Customers are Asking**

When we create content, we need to create it for a reason. Why are we creating the content that we are creating? What purpose does it serve? 

The content you create should be the beginning of your funnel, answering a question that visitors have. From there, the content should strike an interest in the visitor‚Äôs mind, leading them to explore your site more and the services/products you offer. 

In order to know what your customers are searching up, we need to do keyword research. The tools I would recommend are:

* Google Keyword Planner
* Ahrefs
* SpyFu
* Answer the Public
* LSIGraph

These tools help us research keywords that people are searching up on Google. Basically, we can figure out what people are asking, how many people are asking that question, and questions related to what they‚Äôre asking.

To start figuring out what our customers are asking, we need to compile a list of our competitors and a list of themes related to our industry. 

For themes, pick relevant topics surrounding your industry. For example, if you own a pressure washing business, you might have the following topics:

* Gutter Cleaning
* Window Cleaning
* Glass Scratch Removal
* Roof Cleaning

Four topics is more than enough to create content that sufficiently answers your customer‚Äôs questions. Through Keyword Planner, Ahrefs, and SpyFu, we can find questions and topics related to the four topics presented above.

If you have the budget, I HIGHLY recommend getting Ahrefs. They offer some of the best keyword research tools that I‚Äôve ever seen and it gives you a serious advantage over your competitors if you use it right. 

You can get their basic plan for $99/month or you can get a $7 one-week trial which is more than enough time to get enough keyword research done.

Answer the Public and LSIGraph are used to find related keywords to the keywords we find through Ahrefs, SpyFu, and Keyword Planner. These two tools help us find some high-quality questions that your customers are asking, questions that we can answer.

**How to Find the Content Your Competitors Are Creating**

To get even more ideas on the content we should create, we can take a look at our competitors. Compile a list of 5-10 competitors in your area/industry and plug them into Keyword Planner and Ahrefs.

While Keyword Planner will give you keyword ideas based off your competitor‚Äôs content, Ahrefs will actually tell you the keywords they‚Äôre ranking for, their rank, and the difficulty of the keyword.

This makes it incredibly useful to use in situations where we want to outrank our competitors so through Ahrefs, we can find keywords that our competitors aren‚Äôt ranking well for and create even better content than our competitors.

**How to Create Better Content**

So now that we have a list of keywords that we know our customers are searching up, we now need to create content for the keywords. But how do we get on the first page of Google? Some might tell you ‚Äújust create better content.‚Äù

Yes, that‚Äôs one part of the formula. But you also have to take into account linkbuilding and on-site SEO. Content is not king, not without links and an optimized website. 

Now, I have found keywords which I‚Äôve ranked solely through content. But these pieces of content took ages to rank and I was targeting keywords with a difficulty of virtually 0 on a scale of 0-100. Furthermore, most of these keywords have had a volume of 150 searches per month, max.

Our goal here is to create better content than the rankings above us and in order to do so, we need to outperform them in every aspect.

Great content not only answers the searcher‚Äôs question, but any other questions they might have. To find the other questions that people are searching up, you can use Google‚Äôs related search queries on the footer of each search page or you can use a tool like LSIGraph to find which searches are semantically related to your main keyword.

Easy readability, consistent image usage between your content, infographics, and a strong silo structure all contribute to a better piece of content than what your competitors are writing for that keyword.

But how do we get started? Here‚Äôs a to-do list of what you need to do once you‚Äôve determined which keyword you‚Äôre going to target first:

* Take a look at the search results for that keyword. What are the top pages writing? Look for a common theme. Are they all writing ‚Äúbest of‚Äù lists or are they writing informational pieces? How can you outperform them?
* Do not fluff up your content. Be direct and fulfill the user‚Äôs search intent. Then, answer any questions they might also have related to their query.
* Add any useful information that can be presented in a way other than through words. (e.g. images, infographics, videos, etc.)
* Link to any other related pieces of content on your website and likewise, have relevant pieces of content link back to your piece of content within the site. 
* Optimize each header tag, the meta description, and title tag with keyword-related content. Some type of CTA should be added in the title tag to attract more visitors. 

If you follow these steps, you‚Äôll have generated a piece of content that is worthy of being linked to by other websites. But not only that, your initial ranking will also be stronger when Google puts you in their search results. 

Of course, links won‚Äôt build themselves which is why I highly recommend you reach out to other websites and give them a reason to link back to your post. There are several linkbuilding strategies out there that you can choose from. A few to list are:

* The Skyscraper Technique
* Broken Link Reparation
* Link Exchange

**How to Get the Customer**

This is probably the hardest part. Chances are, most visitors are going to bounce after reading your post. A small percentage will check out your website and see what you have to say, but only a few visitors will reach out to you, looking to use your product/service.

To interest as many readers as possible, you need to add CTAs throughout your content. Convince them as to why your service/product is the best out of the ones offered in your post.

For instance, if my service is selling custom trips to the Maldives and I create a piece on the best spots to visit in the Maldives during the summer, I might plug a paragraph mentioning how my travel service offers a full tour of the islands with scuba diving included. 

While you‚Äôre not directly asking the customer to try out your product/service, you are explaining why your service/product should be on their radar. At the end of the content, you can try to directly sell to your visitor, telling them that if they enjoyed the read to check out what you have to offer. 

Don‚Äôt expect conversions to be extremely high. Out of 100 visitors to your piece of content, you might find 3-4 people who are interested in your service/product. But that‚Äôs only one piece of content.

Turning your blog posts into a customer acquisition channel takes time to scale and as you start to create more content, you‚Äôll find that those 3-4 people interested will soon turn into 6-7; and from 6-7 to 11-12 and so on.

Once you scale up your blog with enough valuable content that visitors want to read, you‚Äôll start to see a steady flow of potential clients ready to start working with you. But from there, it‚Äôs not over.

Keeping your blog as a customer acquisition channel takes time and effort. That means you‚Äôre going to need to spend time creating content and building links always. A few hours out of the week every week should be enough to see results but this isn‚Äôt a fast game. Remember. Scaling your blog into an acquisition channel takes time. 

I hope you enjoyed my guide to using your blog to find customers. Seeing as we‚Äôre all stuck in our homes, it‚Äôs the perfect time to start planning our next steps for our businesses. This could be one way many of you scale your business in the coming years. 

If you want me to take a look at the content you already have on your blog, feel free to reach out and I‚Äôll give you some pointers. If you need any other digital marketing help, my inboxes are always open!

Again, don‚Äôt forget. Content takes time to rank and scale before you can start seeing customers flow into your inbox. It‚Äôs a patient game, but it‚Äôs one that pays off if you‚Äôre willing to put in the work.

Stay safe everyone and don‚Äôt forget to wash your hands!",startups,1585210254,jchang2080,2,1,True,2020-03-26

140,Overeaching IP clause in new contract,"Hi, I just got an offer, but they have a clause saying that any IP created by me, whether or not on working time, on any resource, is owned by them. This raised a red flag to me since I want to build side projects on the side and potentially monetize them. I called them and asked them if it can be reworded to not include out of work time, but they said that it would take thousand in legal fees and they cant do that, but they said they won't come after me if it's something totally unrelated (but that's a big grey area). The offer is in a European country so it might be enforceable (pm me if you want to know which exactly).

The problem is that at the moment I don't have a job, and given the current crisis could be 1-2 months before I get another offer. What should I do? Should I just work on my side projects in silence and anonymously, and if one hits off to quit? How likely is this is gonna bite me in the ass in the future?

155,BETA testers wanted for 2112TD!,"Hello there!

We are currently looking for BETA testers to join us in our final stages of developing 2112TD. Currently we are seeking players who own Android and iOS devices.

Don‚Äôt worry if you‚Äôre new to the tower defence genre or if you haven‚Äôt participated BETA testing before ‚Äì We‚Äôre excited to hear from players of all experience levels.

**GAME OVERVIEW**

Set 100 years in the future, battle inter-dimensional hell spawn across the solar system and defend Earth's colonies from complete annihilation.

211TD is a sci-fi tower defence game for Android and iOS combining both classic tower defence and real time strategy features. The pace is steady, but the tensions are high as the relentless hordes amass in an effort to overrun your fortifications. Towers alone cannot stop them and you will need to think strategically, taking advantage of the games unique features such as the airstrike, fortification wall, tactical drone, and special tower abilities.

**DEVELOPMENT**

2112TD is being developed in Unity by a small team working in their free time. Development started in 2012 and the team is now preparing for release, fine tuning gameplay and squashing bugs.

The project has had no external financial investment and is not affiliated with a publisher. 2112TD is being developed with pure passion as a true indie title.

Our team is taking pride in creating a truly awesome tower defence title, combining all of the classic ingredients that make the genre timeless and the game play everlasting. 2112TD‚Äôs artistic style is founded on the nostalgia of the RTS golden era, paying homage to games like Command and Conquer, KKND and Starcraft.

I wanted to share it here too as I thought it would be useful.

Just a note, this is, obviously, not a silver bullet for all your problems, but these are all the steps and things I am personally doing in my business. As with all things on the Internet look at it from your own perspective.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Find ways to do business cheaper**

First things first, if you are spending enormous amounts of money running your business you need to cut your expenditures ASAP. Maximise your cash in the bank. Go through your bank statements and see where your money is going to. Don‚Äôt leave it to your accountant and scrutinise it yourself. It sounds like something you should be doing anyway, but if you aren‚Äôt, you might be surprised at the amount of money that goes out that you will be able to save. Once you know what you are spending your money on ‚Äî you can start cutting those expenses.

In addition to that, I would also look for outgoings that can be replaced with free alternatives. For example, I see many people using [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/) on their website to live chat to customers. Why? It costs you a minimum of $38/month ($456/year). There are tons of alternative services (we use [Freshchat](https://www.freshworks.com/live-chat-software/)) that are free and offer you pretty much the same functionality. Your business will not suffer if you switch from one live-chat app to another.

Once you found all these unnecessary expenses and free alternatives to the services you already use ‚Äî make sure to keep this frugal mindset and don‚Äôt spend money unless absolutely necessary. To keep on top of all my outgoing for my business in the UK, I use [Starling](https://www.starlingbank.com/) bank which sends me a notification every time there is a withdrawal from my bank account. I find it super useful to keep track of every single outgoing.

**2. Find a profitable niche (pivot if necessary)**

In every recession there are winners and losers. You can find numerous [articles](https://self-made.io/recession-proof-seven-businesses-thrive-recessions/1766/) online about the winning niches that do well during economic downturns. Assess wether you are in one of those niches and if not ‚Äî think about how to help businesses in one of those niches that is doing well during a recession.

For example, in the current situation many companies who offer online courses or e-learning tools do very well. My friends, who run a design agency and target restaurants have recently pivoted to designing online course materials and websites. It still utilises their skills, just in an industry that is winning during this crisis.

**3. Invest in technology**

I have previously worked in a large corporate company and I was amazed by the amount of manual labour that went into the creation and management of the services they were selling. As a business, I really recommend that you go on [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/) or [Capterra](https://www.capterra.com.au/) to find software that can free up your employees from manual tasks or that can outright replace them. This will help you save money and stay ahead of your competitors. Trust me, the barriers to trying some new tech for your business are very low, but the results can really save you during difficult times.

**4. Cash flow is king**

Everyone has heard that cash is king beforehand. And I can‚Äôt stress this enough ‚Äî make sure you can get paid as quickly as possible. Don‚Äôt accept 30 or 60 day payment terms. If you are operating on slim margins ‚Äî this will kill you. Find ways to get paid on your terms or find easier ways to get paid. [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), [GoCardlress](https://gocardless.com/) and my friends at [PayHere](https://payhere.co/) all offer very simple solutions for accepting digital payments. Customers will appreciate it and pay you quicker if there is an easy way to pay you.

**5. Help people save/make money**

Uber, AirBnb and What‚ÄôsApp were all started during recessions and became extremely successful. Why? Because they helped people save/make money during bad times. Uber helped people make some extra cash on the side when the times were rough. AirBnb also helped people make extra cash by renting out their spare rooms in a convenient and flexible way. What‚ÄôsApp helped people save by enabling them to message anyone cross-platform for (almost) free.

If you, as a business, can find a way to help people make or save money when finances are rough ‚Äî you will find customers and there will be a lot of demand for your product/service. For example, with [Calbot](https://calbot.cc/i2o4) we help people schedule meetings with qualified leads saving them hours of time per week.",startups,1585243109,tarasmuz,1,1,True,2020-03-26

The product is already built to an MVP level where cups can be put on and the whole process is automated from match lobby to results and cup winners.

What I currently need?

\- Other developers that are interested in getting involved.- Sales/Networking/Marketing partner/s that can take the lead on securing sponsorships for tournaments/events and assist in pulling more players to the platform.

What can I offer?

Not much. The potential of the platform is huge but if you're looking for a side earner this is not it. This is a long haul project that could scale massively in future but will need individuals to put their time in to make it happen. Equity would obviously be available to people who actually put time into it and help drive this forward.

203,"Gamble Crypto on Provably FAIR Casino, LuckyGames (TOP TIER STRATEGY INSIDE)","Hello everyone, with only 0.55 of ETH or BCH (\~$75-$125 deposit) \[LOWER BALANCE + FREE OPTION IS ALSO AVAILABLE AT #6+7 IN THE STRATEGY\], you can start comfortably and consistently making more than $5 a day, and with this gain, you can branch out into other coins which will net you exponential growth. With this method that I will be explaining to you all here, I am now invested in gambling 13 cryptocurrencies at entry levels and am making over $30 a day, and I only started all of this on a new ""proof of concept"" account 20 days ago with a $175 deposit in BCH (0.8BCH).

The method is VERY SIMPLE and takes advantage of low probability of loss bets, and the high exchange rate of crypto to cash, and strategic choice of odds in the DICE game that is offered at LuckyGames.

1st. Make sure you are playing the DICE game

2nd. Set up your dice game to roll UNDER 19.

3rd. You want to set up your bet according to your balance. If you are starting from my initial example, with 0.55 coin, you will want to start with a bet of 0.00000015. Then, you want to increase your bet when you reach 1.05 coin (0.00000030), and again at 2 (0.00000060), and again at 4 (0.00000120), 8 (0.00000240), 16 (0.00000480), 32 (0.00000960), etc. You increase your bet by doubling it, just like you will be doubling your balance. Don't complicate things with your bet. If you keep your bet consistent before reaching the next milestone of balance, you will have an increased probability of continuing to win. With this bet strategy, you will maintain a consistent 0.0002% probability of having a streak long enough for losing \~60%-75% of your balance, and this already extraordinarily low probability goes down as you reach closer to your next doubled balance milestone, which will then double your bet and put your probability back to 0.0002%. This probability is impressively low for the amount of coin you are able to make per day, and should not be underestimated at how much value you can get from this by rolling multiple cryptocurrencies and branching out after just one deposit.

4th. After you have set up your bet according to your balance, you will want to click on the grey AUTO button and set up the left column to INCREASE YOUR BET ON A ""STREAK OF 1 LOSSES"" BY 25%, and you will want to set up the right column to RETURN TO BASE bet ON A ""STREAK OF 1 WINS"". Set the acceleration to maximum, and hit the START AUTOPLAY button at the bottom of the popup.

You will notice that you will get short streaks of lossess followed by streaks of wins etc, and you will notice that your balance will start to slowly crawl up. What is happening is that you are rolling a PROVABLY FAIR dice game and are trying to get the result on the right to roll under the 19 you have placed as your guess. Every time it rolls under, you win 5.21x your bet, which is increasing by 25% every time you lose before winning. This ENSURES that when you eventually win this 19% chance-to-win dice roll, you will win back ALL of what you have already bet and lost during the streak, as well as 2.21x your CURRENT INCREASED bet.

5th. This strategy is remarkable, and is incredibly safe, but PLEASE REMEMBER THAT NOTHING IS GUARANTEED. This website is PROVABLY FAIR and has all of that explained in detail on the website itself, but that means that a freak 0.0002% lose streak CAN HAPPEN, even though it is VERY IMPROBABLE. This is STILL GAMBLING. On the bright side, if you DO reach such a freak lose streak, you will have only lost around 60-75% of your balance, and if you have been withdrawing a certain amount every week and redistributing it into other crypto in the site using the in-site EXCHANGE app, you will probably be playing with profit at that point and it won't put that bad of a dent in your game.

6th. IF YOU DONT HAVE THAT BIG OF A BALANCE BUDGET, what you can do is use 0.55 of a DIFFERENT lower value coin. The beauty of gambling crypto is that the strategy REMAINS EXACTLY THE SAME no matter what crypto you are gambling, the only difference is that you will be making substatially less money... but you can still funnel your profits into other low value crypto, and work your way up from there. Don't be discouraged if you don't have a big budget for gambling. THIS STRATEGY WILL STILL MOST LIKELY BE PROFITABLE for you.

7th. If you would like to try this strategy FOR FREE using LUCKY TOKEN (which can be traded in for VIP/LEGEND time \[which gives access to a bitcoin faucet of 1000/2000 satoshis per 30min\] OR EVEN IPHONES/MACBOOK PRO\], or if you would like to make a deposit and get started with gambling crypto with a top tier strategy, please show me some love üíö for making this guide and sign up at LuckyGames using my affiliate link:

If you continue to log in every day for 5 days, you will be able to receive 1000 lucky tokens every 1 minute when you deplete your tokens, via the faucet on the left (TOKEN app in the menu).  The best strategy to get started is to roll the max balance of 1000+ tokens on a 99x roll (either under 1 or over 98).  This will yeild in almost 100,000 tokens, and you can try to hit it once every minute for no cost at all other than some captcha.  Once you get to 100,000 tokens, you can implement the method by starting at 0.05 bet under 19 increase by 25% on streak of 1 LOSS, then double every time your balance doubles.

237,Shhhhh! The Revolutionary SEC Law That Venture Capitalists and Startups Don‚Äôt Use!," 

**Shhhhh!** That's the first thing you learn when raising funds for a startup, or running a venture capital fund. You can't let the common people know! No advertising is permitted, and even publicly discussing the fact that you are collecting funds could get you in trouble with the SEC. But this practice has been obsolete for 7 years, and nobody in the venture capital and startup world seems to know it.

The SEC rule commonly used by startups and VC funds, rule 506(b) of Regulation D, allows them to be exempted from the many reporting and disclosure regulations applied to stocks traded on the market, but at a severe cost: all investors must be accredited, meaning that they must have a degree of sophistication in investment and wealth greater than the common person.

Meant to protect regular people from investments that don't report enough information to allow them to make a reasoned decision, the other effect of the accreditation requirement is that *only rich people can play.* You are not allowed to invest in these high-risk, high-reward funds issued by startups and venture capital funds, unless you are wealthy or you yourself are a founder of the business. A net worth of a Million *excluding* the value of your home, or annual income in excess of $200,000 for an unmarried person and $300,000 common income for a married couple, are required.

Rule 506(b) requires businesses that wish to be exempted from reporting requirements must raise money *privately.* Advertising for investors is not allowed. They can't talk about their solicitation of funds to people who aren't accredited. They can only make solicitations of investors who self-declare themselves as accredited. You‚Äôre supposed to have a phone book full of moneybags that you can approach quietly.

This means that startups and venture funds are under severe restrictions of their speech by SEC. You can't talk about your solicitation for funds where the lowly non-accredited person can hear it. In practice, their lawyers tell them not to publicly discuss anything connected with a fund-raise, or even that their fund exists. Many software companies sell *virtual data rooms* to shut out the hoi polloi, secure data stores that accredited people can be invited to enter to view and sign documents, while the lowly non-accredited are locked out of that information.

Obviously, this made it difficult for businesses to raise money. So, in 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, was passed into law. In the words of SEC, the JOBS act ‚Äúis intended, among other things, to reduce barriers to capital formation, particularly for smaller companies.‚Äù Enacted in 2013 as rule 506(c) of Regulation D, it allows solicitations of capital that are exempted from reporting requirements similarly to rule 506(b), but ""general solicitation"" that is visible to un-accredited people is allowed, including advertising of the solicitation. Thus, businesses are released from the odious restrictions on speech. The cost of this is that the requirement for accreditation of investors is increased. A fund operating under 506(c) can not just take the world of an investor that they are accredited. They must actively verify it, using tax forms, bank statements, etc.

Fortunately, there are third-party companies that will perform accredited investor verification for as little as $60, and will keep the documents presented by the investor private. Two such companies are:

* [VerifyInvestor.com](https://verifyinvestor.com/)
* [EarlyIQ](https://www.earlyiq.com/investor-verification)

Use of these companies is advantageous to the investor and the fund, because the fund need never be exposed to the investor's private documents. They just get a pass or fail report on the investor's accredited status.

Rule 506(c), to date, is mostly used by real estate funds. Even SEC does not understand why VCs and startups do not use it more. The Director of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance, Keith Higgins, said ‚Äúone wonders why the new Rule 506(c) exemption has not caught on more widely with issuers who have long clamored for the general solicitation ban to be lifted.‚Äù There is the additional requirement of validation, with its increased paperwork load on prospective investors, but the effect of this is reduced by using third party validation companies that shield those documents from view, even by the fund that requested validation.

I first encountered rule 506(c) after I had been a partner at [OSS Capital](https://oss.capital/) for a year. I had felt constrained by the restrictions on speech that fund has under rule 506(b). When I started to found a separate company, the business incubator or ‚Äúventure studio‚Äù [Incubator.Fund](https://incubator.fund/), I resolved to use rule 506(c), and not simply for the free speech advantages. I have dedicated most of my life to charity, as one of the founders of the Open Source movement in software, and did not have a *personal network,* a phone book full of moneybags to raise funds from privately, as rule 506(b) assumes. The ability to advertise, using rule 506(c), allows me to reach far beyond my personal network.

[Incubator.Fund](https://incubator.fund/) is doing its initial bootstrap raise in the worst of times: in the middle of the COVID-19 disaster. The bootstrap investors will fund the legal and other work necessary to start the fund and its first incubated companies, and then to solicit for additional limited partners. Those bootstrap investors will be offered a portion of the general partner for taking the risk at the worst of times. Without rule 506(c), I doubt we‚Äôd have a chance to find the investors who will ride the market to better times with us.

You can eat almost nothing,

it is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

Chefs also rotate

A meal is going to be cheap

You get new foods every day. After a period of time : you will have eaten thousands of foods

246,Intellectual insight and content discussed in a realexed format,"My idea is to have attractive women talk about intellectual content, similar to that of drunk history in the sense that intellectual content is discussed but in a relaxed environment. I would ensure that these women have intellectual and intelligent things to share by writing their scripts and making it entertaining for the viewers. 

I want to bridge the gap between those who are interested in learning and those who have low attention spans and or hold stigma towards heavy academic lectures such as Ted talks. There are many content creators who have valuable information to share although due to their identities and or political views they are polorizing in nature (e.g. Ben Shapiro, Alex Jones, etc). I want to change that perception! 

The plan would be to start on YouTube, and recruit women from Instagram and or other social media platforms with a small following and eventually work my way up the ladder to more sought after individuals with larger followings. Right now I'm thinking it could be topics that are either related to politics and current events or about academic concepts related to science and astrophysics/cosmology, and it would be similar to the format of a podcast/talkshow/youtube channel, although obviously nothing is set in stone as the idea only exists in my mind at the moment. To generate revenue I would initially be reliant on YouTube CPM advertisement revenue, then sponsors, and eventually I would transition to my own platform with a subscription basis in the case that I am successful with it.

I'm interested to hear your thoughts on the concept/plan and any comments you could offer that would be helpful in terms of developing the idea further.

272,Should we try to get new users in the coronavirus era?,"Hi Everyone,

**TL;DR: If users wont be able to use the app's core feature in the coronavirus era. Should we try to get new users?**

**Intro:**We are a consumer focused mobile app startup. We launched our app into the market on 20th March 2020 and currently have around 40 users. We are using the following avenues to get more users:

1. Creating a food blog on social media platforms like Instagram, FB, Twitter.
2. Asking our friends and their friends to try our app
3. Reaching out to folks who participated in our market research survey (Not doing this yet!)

**Problem:**We are getting some new users through options 1 &amp; 2, but the engagement is negligible as the app needs users to eat restaurant food. In the age of coronavirus, consumers are wary of ordering pickup/delivery or eating at a restaurant (and rightfully so).

The question I want to ask is should we try strategy like option 3, which might get us new users but at a risk of them uninstalling the app, as they wont be able to use the app's core feature.

Pros:

* We get new users with strategies like option 3
* We would gain brand recognition
* If they don't uninstall the app. Post coronavirus, we can drive user engagement up with other tools (like in-app notification and emails)

Cons:

* This will result in user install and then uninstall the app as it's not going to be useful now
* Users won't care about the app and they will never come back

285,What payment to ask for?,"Hello everyone.

I hope some of you will be able to give me some enlightenment.

The situation is as follows:

I had an idea, I wanted to import something that I saw as necessary in my country. Since I knew the suppliers from before, and the prices they could offer I knew this would also succeed (well, I hoped it would).

I found a man who has the company with the right legal permission to import the stuff and the capital to cover it all since I don't, and he also knows the people who will be buying the stuff.

So he has me 3 to 1... even a bit more considering the capital to be invested. It was my idea, and I know I am irreplaceable for this business, and it will be quite big and profitable.

So what kind of payment can I demand? A percentage of the profit + fixed price seemed reasonable to me, but I had no prior experience in this.",startups,1585474167,Carageavk,2,1,True,2020-03-29

This partner will get a percentage of the business and profits, and invest a little bit upfront for things like a dedicated phone, email account, and maybe some marketing.

*Little context on the business*

\- My software startup business (incorporated) Jan 2019.

\- HQ San Francisco

\- $0 in revenue (we're a software startup, expected)

\- $0 in payroll to this date

\- Product built/Have users (if relevant)

\- I raised $85k in angel funds for a pre-seed in 2019

\- Have $40k in debt on the business, not from a loan, but invoices from my product team (a service provider) and legal firm.

\- Have taken no loans out for the business to date

&amp;#x200B;

**In Q1-Q2 I was expecting to raise our seed round, between $750k to $2MM**

\- At the closing of the seed round both her and I we're going to get salaries

\- Regardless though, Im applying my startup for the SBA EIDL ($10k grant specifically), which I'm in the process right now of filling out, BUT **haven't submitted anything yet and won't until I know the best route for the below question**

\------

*Context for the question*

My wife quit her job in september 2019 to work for me

(unpaid, again though her and I haven't paid ourselves anything from the company yet)

&amp;#x200B;

More so the question here, what can she claim (whether for the business or try unemployment) for the best route which returns the most money for us?

\- Option 1: Should my wife be linked as an 'employee' on the SBA EIDL?  Could this help our chances at getting more for the SBA/EIDL?

***-or-***

\- Option 2:  Should she try to make a claim for unemployment?

\- Option 3:  Is there something else?

Note:  No official docs have been signed by her as an employee of the business yet (we could do that really quick though if I need to, I have those docs)

361,How to find your first 500 beta users without spending money,"Hey there! 

I've written a blogpost on how to find your first hundred beta users when you don't have money to spend on marketing. Hope it can help a few here!

&amp;#x200B;

When you're finally launching your beta and have an MVP, your next step is finding users to try out your beta product, play around with it, criticize it, give you feedback: they're your beta testers. And they're an essential part of your startup journey. 

But you're new at this. You have no money to spend on marketing. So how do you ""manually"" find you first hundred beta users? 

Below is a compiled list of tools, tips and platforms we used with our startup (focused on privacy) that helped us find our first users and build an awesome community of beta users. Hope this can help you out!

&amp;#x200B;

\-**REDDIT:** Reddit is a great platform with a gigantic amount of people, divided into lots of different subreddits. You can find everything on Reddit. A good way to start is to join a few subreddits that correspond to your first targeted niche markets for your product. This obviously depends on your sector/industry (although you can join these subreddits regardless for a start: r/betatests r/alphaandbetausers, r/testmyapp). Think about which groups your audience would go to, or where your competitors are. ¬†

Bear in mind though, that promoting your product may be against the rules or frowned upon in some subreddits, and in that case if you do so you may get some hostility. Read the rules, you can also message the moderators if you're unsure. At the very least, be honest about promoting your product, ask for genuine feedback. I'd also recommend giving some value to the community, by sharing useful content, or helping out. 

Reddit is a great informative platform with a lot of smart redditors: you can really get a lot of value from it.

**-HACKER NEWS:** Another big platform with a tech savyy audience. If you get on the landing page it's thousand of views. Check it out and see how it works before posting anything. There's a specific section called ""Show HN"" where you can ""share something that you've made"". ¬†Would highly recommend it, you may not only get a lot of traffic, but also very useful feedback. Bear in mind that, similar to Reddit, the feedback is usually brutally honest. Learning to differentiate useful and constructive feedback from ""haters"" takes some practice. Additionally, if you have a blog you can post your blogposts there. 

**-PRODUCT HUNT:** Product Hunt is a website that lets users share and discover new products. It allows early stage startups to promote their products. Posting your product there is a great way to get traction (the more upvotes you get, the bigger the chance to feature on the landing page, and that's a lot of views), potential beta users, and feedback. The community is full of enthusiastic tech people. Apparently the best time to post is around 10am CET on a Tuesday or Wednesday (based on the particular cycle product hunt has in place), but that's up for debate. We posted on a Wednesday morning and it worked out very well for us.

**-CONTENT MARKETING:** Start a blog. Write. Make videos. If you've developed your product you must have good knowledge of your industry. Share that knowledge with your audience. Write stuff that gives value to your relevant community, that can be useful and informative. Show you're an expert in your industry. For example, we recently started a blog where the idea is to regularly publish content on privacy, tips on how to increase your online privacy, what a hacker is, etc. We are planning on releasing interactive videos as well. People will appreciate your informative (and fun) content, it gives you legitimacy, and that way you may start building a solid base of loyal followers. 

Post that content on **social media** (your personal and company Twitter profile, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook with relevant groups,...): post relevant content to attract audience. Sharable content can go viral.

**-BETA WEBSITES:** There are a few websites that allow you to post your app/product in beta (e.g. Betalist, which is free). 

\-**FORUMS:** Look for online forums and discussions that may be relevant for you.

**-QUORA:** Very big platform. Help out the community by answering questions that people may have in your sector. That can also get you a lot of views.

**-SHAPR:** A ""professional tinder"" app, that allows you to interact with people based on your selected key words. May be worth giving it a try. We've definitely managed to meet a few of our beta testers there. It can take a while though, as you're not posting to a large audience, instead it's more of a chat app. This can be a good thing when you're looking for your very first beta users.

\-**INFLUENCERS:** As for most things, network is everything. There are most probably influencers/bloggers in your industry with a large community of followers. Connect with them. See how you can help each other out. 

**-EVENTS:** Go to as many events as you can (events related to your industry, startup events, pitch events,..). Obviously the quantity and quality of events available to you largely depend on where you live. If you live in a capital, e.g. London, you're in a great place to connect with important people and prospective users. You may find these events on the Meetup app, or with a simple Google search. Don't understestimate how useful these events can be! Important connections can be made, and a lot of people will get even more excited to use your product when they meet you in person. Also, I'd recommed you pitch as much as you can, especially when you reach this stage. Pitching can be very beneficial, it allows you to 1)grow in confidence about your product and yourself in public, which is super important, 2)understand the recurrent questions people have about your business, which helps you with perfecting your message, how you communicate your product with the world, marketing, and feedback, 3) make yourself known. We've been to a few pitching events and it has considerably helped us find users, influencers, potential investors, and meet some amazing people. 

Voila! These are some of the tools/platforms/methods we've used so far, that have allowed us to grow an awesome community of beta users! No money has been spent on marketing so far. It is, of course, still early stage for us, since we're still in beta. We hope this can help you somehow!

362,New startup ideas: Give up or start all over again?,"I'm a journalist. I've been reading different opinions and sources regarding whether you should leverage these times to develop your startup ideas or give them up completely. So far, [this article](https://www.axios.com/sequoia-capital-calls-coronavirus-the-black-swan-of-2020-1b908823-989d-4f55-b526-aac846cbcd65.html) makes the most sense to me because it advises preparing for the worse if you continue to move forward with your business idea and trying to find VC. More optimistic approaches [like this one](https://slidebean.com/blog/startups-pitch-deck-financial-model), suggest that the time to polish your deck and your financial model is now.

To me, the thought of giving up is really not entrepreneur-like. So, I'm interested in reading what this community has to say. My overall conclusion is that there are some industries that clearly gained momentum now and can have an opportunity to contain more/better businesses in the long term:

Online learning - Online fitness - Food safety consultants - Sterile delivery services - New sterile tactile technologies - Online event planning - Conferencing/Teamwork software - Remote medical services - Free or more accessible independent online content of all sorts

364,How to get on the front-page of Hacker News,"Hey Everyone, 

We recently got our startup #1 on the front page of Hacker News. I wrote a twitter üßµ and wanted to share it here. Hopefully, some of you find it useful and can get your product on the front-page too.

1) Build a lean, but usable MVP    
Focus on the core features of your product. Don't start building every little thing you can think of. What do you need to build for your product to function? For us, it was users searching and applying to jobs.

2) Get early user feedback and build an audience   
Join communities where your target audience hangs out and be an active member. Provide value, feedback, and ask questions. We are an active member of [@GetMakerlog](https://twitter.com/GetMakerlog), [@IndieHackers](https://twitter.com/IndieHackers), [@reddit](https://twitter.com/reddit), and [@pioneerdotapp](https://twitter.com/pioneerdotapp).

We would not be where we are without their early feedback. We constantly talked to our users, asking if they found value in our product, if they would keep using it, what would they like to see and iterated based on that feedback.

3) Launch repeatedly    
We launched 2 times before on [@newsycombinator](https://twitter.com/newsycombinator) before getting to #1. Every week, we updated communities of new features/milestones like [@GetMakerlog](https://twitter.com/GetMakerlog), [@IndieHackers](https://twitter.com/IndieHackers), [@reddit](https://twitter.com/reddit), [@LinkedIn](https://twitter.com/LinkedIn), and [@Twitter](https://twitter.com/Twitter).

5) Make sure your server can handle the traffic   
 Prepare for the best-case scenario. You do not want to upgrade your server during launch day as your site will be down for 10 mins or more. We scaled our [@linode](https://twitter.com/linode) server up 2 hours before our launch which helped tremendously.

6) Collect emails    
Add a way for users to subscribe to your mailing list. Make sure it's ready before you launch. We collected emails to our Postgres database and transferred it to [@Mailchimp](https://twitter.com/Mailchimp).  
7) Make your title personal and less marketing-y  
 Example:    
\`Show HN: I made a site that lets you subscribe to pet food delivery\`    
Our HN title:  \`Show HN: I made a site that aggregates entry-level positions\`

Launch Day:  
1) Launch your product at 12:01 am PST    
Posting at 12:01 am maximizes your product's 24-hour time frame. When we launched, we had the highest # of traffic between 12 am - 6 am pst. If we had launched any later, we would have missed out.

2) The first hour is the most critical     
We shared our HN post with a few friends within the first hour which helped move us from newest to show. From there, we were in the top 10 on Show HN which helped with more people viewing and we took off.

3) Announce your launch in the communities mentioned in #3     
People that follow you and like what your doing will check out your launch. If you're in the front-page by now, leverage that and let people know. We sent out multiple updates letting our followers know where we placed.

4) Reply to comments on your HN page    
Stay in the comments and reply positively. Hacker News comments can destroy your launch so be careful. Luckily, we received lots of good feedback. Our product, rose through the ranks thanks to the comments.

And that's all we really did. I believe if it worked for us and many others, it will work for you. Good luck!",startups,1585612333,yellowpanda6,10,1,True,2020-03-30

369,Growing and I‚Äôm not sure how to handle additional help,"I currently have a web design LLC that I run with a co-founder. We are 50/50 and have been in business together for 6 good years.  We recently came up with a great idea that we have found a market for, however we are too busy to sell it. We found someone excited and willing to sell it for us but they want 25% of the income which we agreed to. How do I handle this person? Are they considered an independent contractor at that point? We have had it easy as a two member LLC so I‚Äôm kind of lost on how to handle this person. We don‚Äôt want to add them to the LLC if possible since we run various projects under the LLC. An additional programmer is also interested for 10% of income. Can I keep my LLC intact the way it is and just give the sales person and programmer their share of the income? Collect W9s and send 1099s? Thank you very much for any info and help!",startups,1585619293,chasm_of_sarcasm,4,1,True,2020-03-30
